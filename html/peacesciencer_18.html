<h2>Add Estimates of Leader Willingness to Use Force to Leader-Year Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_lwuf()</code> allows you to add estimates of leader
willingness to use force to leader-year data or leader-dyad-year data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_lwuf(data, keep)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a leader-year or leader dyad-year data frame as generated in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional argument, specified as a character vector, of the variables from the <code>lwuf</code> data frame
the user wants in their data. See the <code>lwuf</code> data and its documentation for more. If the argument is unspecified,
the function will return all measures of leader willingness to use force as generated by Carter and Smith.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>See <code>lwuf</code> for more information, but I'll copy-paste it here
too.
</p>
<p>The letter published by Carter and Smith (2020) contains more information
as to what these thetas refer. The "M1" theta is a variation of the standard
Rasch model from the boilerplate information in the LEAD data. The authors
consider this to be "theoretically relevant" or "risk-related" as these all
refer to conflict or risk-taking. The "M2" theta expands on "M1" by
including political orientation and psychological characteristics. "M3" and
"M4" expand on "M1" and "M2" by considering all 36 variables in the LEAD
data.
</p>
<p>The authors construct and include all these measures, though their analyses
suggest "M2" is the best-performing measure. You should probably consider
using <code>theta2_mean</code> as your default estimate of leader willingness
to use force in leader-year analyses.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_lwuf()</code> takes a leader-year or leader-dyad-year data
frame and adds estimates of leader willingness to use force, as
generated by Carter and Smith (2020).
