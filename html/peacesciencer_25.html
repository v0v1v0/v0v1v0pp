<h2>Add Thompson and Dreyer's (2012) strategic rivalry data to dyad-year data frame</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_strategic_rivalries()</code> merges in Thompson and Dreyer's (2012) strategic rivalry data
to a dyad-year data frame. The right-bound, as of right now, are bound at 2010.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_strategic_rivalries(data, across_types = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a dyad-year data frame (either "directed" or "non-directed")</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>across_types</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, relevant for state-year, takes a value of 1, 2, or 3 to look for
whether one of three types fits criteria for ideological, interventionary, positional, spatial
rivalry. Defaults to 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>add_strategic_rivalries()</code> will include some other information derived from the rivalry data that the
user may not want (e.g. start year of the rivalry). Feel free to select those out after the fact. Function includes
an on-the-fly adjustment for Austria for rivalry #79. In this case, the Austria-Serbia rivalry continues for two years
after Austria-Hungary (<code>ccode: 300</code>) became Austria (<code>ccode: 305</code>).
</p>
<p>The <code>across_types</code> argument is optional and observed for only state-year calls. It defaults to 1. At the default,
the function looks into the rivalry data (in <code>td_rivalries</code>) and focuses on the <code>type1</code> column. If, say, a state has
an ongoing rivalry and it is primarily spatial, it codes that as a spatial rivalry. Assume you input <code>across_types = 2</code>, the
function then looks across both the <code>type1</code> and <code>type2</code> columns to see if there is a spatial component to the rivalry as
either its primary or secondary dimension. If so, it codes that as a 1. <code>across_types</code> must be 1, 2, or 3.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_strategic_rivalries()</code> takes a dyad-year data frame and adds information about ongoing strategic rivalries. It
will also include a simple dummy variable for whether there was an ongoing rivalry in the year or not.
For state-year data, it returns the count of ongoing strategic rivalries for the state in the year meeting a certain criteria (i.e.
whether the state has an interventionary, ideological, positional, or spatial rivalry in an ongoing year, and how many).
