<h2>placer: A package to estimate the accumulation of plastic debris in bird's nests</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package placer consist of two main functions to estimate the accumulation of plastic
in bird's nest as a function of sample size, and a routine to plot the plastic prevalence
probability, and their confidence intervals as a function of sample size.
</p>


<h3>Main functions</h3>

<p>The function <code>plastic.prev.prob</code> calculates the plastic
prevalence probability for a given sample size based on presence and absence data
The function <code>plastic.ci</code> estimates the 95% confidence intervals for a given
prevalence probability of plastic debris. In addition, the package placer includes a plotting
routine <code>prevalence_plot</code> to show the estimated plastic prevalence probability and
their 95% confidence intervals as a function of sample size.
