<h2>Partially Balanced Incomplete Block Designs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The PBIB designs are important type of incomplete block designs having wide area of their applications for example in agricultural experiments, in plant breeding, in sample surveys etc. This package constructs various series of PBIB designs and assists in checking all the necessary conditions of PBIB designs and the association scheme on which these designs are based on. It also assists in calculating the efficiencies of PBIB designs with any number of associate classes. The package also constructs Youden-m square designs which are Row-Column designs for the two-way elimination of heterogeneity. The incomplete columns of these Youden-m square designs constitute PBIB designs. With the present functionality, the package will be of immense importance for the researchers as it will help them to construct PBIB designs, to check if their PBIB designs and association scheme satisfy various necessary conditions for the existence, to calculate the efficiencies of PBIB designs based on any association scheme and to construct Youden-m square designs for the two-way elimination of heterogeneity.</p>

PBIBD-package           Partially Balanced Incomplete Block Designs
apbibd                  Calculates the efficiencies of PBIB designs
                        with any number of associate classes.
circulant               This function generates circulant matrix of
                        order n.
series1                 This function constructs five-associate class
                        PBIB designs.
series2                 This function constructs five-associate class
                        PBIB designs
series3                 This function constructs five-associate class
                        PBIB designs
series4                 This function constructs three-associate class
                        PBIB designs.
series5                 This function constructs three-associate class
                        PBIB designs.
series6                 This function constructs three-associate class
                        PBIB designs.
verify                  Verifies all the necessary conditions for the
                        existence of PBIB designs based on any
                        association scheme.
ym1                     The function constructs Youden-m square
                        designs. The function provides the parameters
                        of the PBIB design constituted when the
                        incomplete columns of this Youden-m square are
                        taken as blocks.

                        designs. The function provides the parameters
                        of the PBIB design constituted when the
                        incomplete columns of this Youden-m square are
                        taken as blocks.
ym3                     The function constructs Youden-m square
                        designs. The function provides the parameters
                        of the PBIB design constituted when the
                        incomplete columns of this Youden-m square are
                        taken as blocks.
