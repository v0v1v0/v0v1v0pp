<h2>Absorbance spectra for chlorophylls.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Optical absorption spectra of chlorophyll a in methanol and chlorophylls
a and by in diethyl ether containing the wavelengths at 1 nm interval.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>filter_mspct</code> with three member <code>filter_spct</code> objects
each with variable number of rows and 2 numeric variables, <code>w.length</code>
and <code>A</code>
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The variables of the member spectra are as follows:
</p>
 <ul>
<li>
<p> w.length (nm) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A (spectral absorbance) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data from PhotochemCAD 2.1a has been munged on 2 June 2017 by Scott
Prahl (<a href="https://omlc.org/">https://omlc.org/</a>) to make the information available to
non-Windows users. Although he has tried to be as careful as possible, he
may have introduced some error; the cautious user is advised to compare
these results with the original sources (Du et al., 1998; Dixon et al., 2005).
</p>
<p>The spectral absorption measurements of chlorophyll <code class="reqn">a</code> in methanol,
chlorophyll <code class="reqn">a</code> and chlorophyll <code class="reqn">b</code> in diethyl ether were made by J.
Li on 12-11-1997 using a Cary 3 spectrophotometer. The absorption values were
collected using a spectral bandwidth of 1.0 nm, a signal averaging time of
0.133 sec, a data interval of 0.25 nm, and a scan rate of 112.5 nm/min.
</p>
<p>Chlorophyll <code class="reqn">a</code> measurements were scaled to make the molar extinction
coefficient match the value of 111700 cm-1/M at 417.8 nm. These values were
then interpolated to report extinction coefficients at regular 1 nm intervals.
The reported molar extinction coefficient is from Strain et al. (1963).
</p>
<p>Chlorophyll <code class="reqn">b</code> measurements were scaled to make the molar extinction
coefficient match the value of 159100 cm-1/M at 453.0 nm. These values were
then interpolated to report extinction coefficients at regular 1 nm intervals.
The reported molar extinction coefficient is from Vernon and Seely (1966).
