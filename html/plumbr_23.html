<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>ItemSelection</code> class implements
<code>Selection</code> for the selection of 1D and 2D regions
in plot/data space.
</p>


<h3>Constructor</h3>

<ul><li>
<p><code>RegionSelection(delegate = NULL)</code>: Constructs
an <code>RegionSelection</code> object with the underlying selection
provided by <code>delegate</code>, which may be a function or any other
R object. If it is not a function, <code>delegate</code> must support
coercion to a <code>matrix</code> as described in the next section.
However, <code>delegate</code> is usually a function that is invoked
whenever the selection is stored or retrieved. If the function is
called with no arguments, it should return the
selection. Otherwise, the argument is the new selection status,
and the function should store it. This is the same semantic as
active bindings. This dynamic
functionality allows proxying of other <code>Selection</code> objects or
external sources, such as a selection model from a GUI toolkit.

</p>
</li></ul>
<h3>Interpreting the Selection</h3>

<p>Any R object can represent the underlying selection, so for simplicity
we recommend that the client interpret the selection through
coercion. Currently, there is only one supported coercion of
<code>RegionSelection</code>:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p><code>as.matrix(x)</code>: returns a matrix with a column for each
dimension and a row for each point. In the 2D case, the points
describe one or more polygons. As with the <code>polygon</code>
function, polygons are separated by rows of <code>NA</code>, and the last
point is connected with the first. In the 1D case, the single column
might encode, for example, selections of factor levels in an area
plot.

</p>
</li></ul>
<p>We will probably need to add more coercions as use cases arise. This
is still very preliminary.
</p>


<h3>Supported Selection Calculus</h3>

<p>For now, <code>RegionSelection</code> only supports the <code>add</code> operation
described in the documentation for <code>Selection</code>.
