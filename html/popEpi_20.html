<h2>Flexible Variable Usage in <span class="pkg">popEpi</span> Functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Certain arguments in <span class="pkg">popEpi</span> can be passed in multiple 
ways. This document shows the usage and a pitfall in the
usage of such flexible arguments.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Flexible arguments in <span class="pkg">popEpi</span> are used to pass variables existing
in your data or in the environment where the function is used 
(for everyday users this is the global environment - in simple terms,
where your data is / your work space). The flexible arguments
are modelled after the <code>by</code> argument in <code>data.tables</code> - 
see <code>?data.table</code>. There are many ways to supply the same information
to certain functions in <span class="pkg">popEpi</span>, but the possible ways listed below
may be limited in some of them to only allow for using only a part of them.
</p>


<h3>Everyday usage</h3>

<p>Most commonly you may pass
variable names as character strings, e.g.
</p>
<p><code>FUN(arg = c("V1", "V2"), data = x)</code>
</p>
<p>which may be stored in advance:
</p>
<p><code>vars &lt;- c("V1", "V2")</code>
</p>
<p><code>FUN(arg = vars, data = x)</code>
</p>
<p>where <code>x</code> contains those variables. You may also supply variable
names as symbols:
</p>
<p><code>FUN(arg = V1, data = x)</code>
</p>
<p>Or as a list of symbols (similarly to as in <code>aggregate</code>):
</p>
<p><code>FUN(arg = list(V1, V2), data = x)</code>
</p>
<p>Or as a list of expressions:
</p>
<p><code>FUN(arg = list(V1 + 1, factor(V2)), data = x)</code>
</p>
<p>A formula without a left-hand-side specified is sometimes allowed as well:
</p>
<p><code>FUN(arg = ~ I(V1 + 1) + factor(V2), data = x)</code>
</p>
<p>Using a symbol or a list of symbols/expressions typically
causes the function to look for the variable(s)
first in the supplied data (if any) and then where the function was called.
For everyday users this means you might define e.g.
</p>
<p><code>V3 &lt;- factor(letters)</code>
</p>
<p>and do e.g.
</p>
<p><code>FUN(arg = list(V1 + 1, factor(V2), V3), data = x)</code>
</p>
<p>provided <code>V1</code> and <code>V2</code> exist in <code>x</code> or in the function calling
environment.
</p>


<h3>A pitfall</h3>

<p>There is one way to use flexible arguments incorrectly: By supplying
the name of a variable which exists both in the supplied data
and the calling environment, and intending the latter to be used. E.g.
</p>
<p><code>vars &lt;- c("V2")</code>
</p>
<p><code>FUN(arg = V3, data = x)</code>
</p>
<p>where <code>x</code> has a column named <code>vars</code>. This causes the function to
use <code>x$vars</code> and NOT <code>x$V2</code>.
</p>


<h3>Advanced</h3>

<p>Function programmers are advised to pass character strings
whenever possible. To fool-proof against conflicts as described in the
section above, refer to the calling environment explicitly when
passing the variable containing the character strings:
</p>
<p><code>TF &lt;- environment() ## current env to refer to</code>
</p>
<p><code>vars &lt;- c("V1", "V2")</code>
</p>
<p><code>FUN(arg = TF$vars, data = x)</code>
</p>
<p>Even if <code>x</code> has columns named <code>vars</code> and <code>TF</code>, 
using <code>TF$vars</code> does not use those columns but only evaluates
<code>TF$vars</code>
in the calling environment. This is made possible by the fact
that data is always passed as a <code>data.frame</code>, within which evaluation
of expressions using the dollar operator is not possible. Therefore
it is safe to assume the data should not be used. However, lists of 
expressions will not be checked for dollar use and will fail in conflict
situations:
</p>
<p><code>TF &lt;- environment() ## current env to refer to</code>
</p>
<p><code>vars &lt;- letters[1:5]</code>
</p>
<p><code>x &lt;- data.frame(vars = 1:5, TF = 5:1, V1 = 10:6)</code>
</p>
<p><code>FUN(arg = list(TF$vars, V1), data = x)</code>
</p>
<p>On the other hand you may typically also pass quoted (<code>quote</code>)
or substituted <code>substitute</code> expressions etc., where
the <code>env$object</code> trick will work as well:
</p>
<p><code>q &lt;- quote(list(vars, V1))</code>
</p>
<p><code>FUN(arg = TF$q, data = x)</code>
</p>
<p>This works even with
</p>
<p><code>a &lt;- 1:5</code>
</p>
<p><code>V1 &lt;- quote(TF$a)</code>
</p>
<p><code>FUN(arg = TF$V1, data = x)</code>
</p>
<p>So no conflicts should occur.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
data(sire)
## prepare data for e.g. 5-year "period analysis" for 2008-2012
## note: sire is a simulated cohort integrated into popEpi.
BL &lt;- list(fot=seq(0, 5, by = 1/12))
x &lt;- lexpand(sire, birth = bi_date, entry = dg_date, exit = ex_date,
             status = status %in% 1:2,
             breaks = BL)
              
x &lt;- aggre(x, by = fot)

## silly example of referring to pyrs data by fixed character string;
## its possible that the real name wont be fixed in a real-life application.
pyrs &lt;- "actual_pyrs"  
TF &lt;- environment()
x$actual_pyrs &lt;- as.numeric(x$pyrs)
x$pyrs &lt;- 1
             
## this works (uses actual_pyrs eventually)
st &lt;- survtab_ag(fot ~ 1, data = x, surv.type = "surv.obs",
                 pyrs = TF$pyrs, d = from0to1, 
                 surv.method = "hazard")
## this would be wrong (sees expression 'pyrs' and uses that column,
## which is not what is intended here)
st &lt;- survtab_ag(fot ~ 1, data = x, surv.type = "surv.obs",
                 pyrs = pyrs, d = from0to1,
                 surv.method = "hazard")
