<h2>Re-estimate a new set size to split a number of items into equally sized sets.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is useful for plotting large datasets where multiple pages are needed.
E.g. you know that you need 101 barplots, but you only want to fit about 25 per page.
Naively one would now do five plots, with the last one only containing a single barplot.
Using this function with correctSetSize(101, 25) would tell you to use 26 barplots per page,
so you end up with four plots, all roughly equally filled.
It also works the other extreme case, where your initial size is chosen slightly too high, e.g.
Sets of size 5 for just 8 items is too much, because we can reduce the set size to 4 and still
need two sets but now they are much more equally filled (correctSetSize(8, 5) == 4).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">correctSetSize(item_count, initial_set_size)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>item_count</code></td>
<td>
<p>Known number of items which need to assigned to sets</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>initial_set_size</code></td>
<td>
<p>Desired number of items a single set should hold</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>We allow for up to set sizes of 150% from default, to avoid the last set being sparse (we remove it and distribute to the other bins)
150
Once the number of sets is fixed, we distribute all items equally.
</p>
<p>E.g. 6 items &amp; initial_set_size=5, would result in 2 bins (5 items, 1 item), but we'd rather have one bin of 6 items
or 8 items &amp; initial_set_size=5, would result in 2 bins (5+3 items), since the last set is more than half full, but we'd rather have 4+4
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>re-estimated set size which a set should hold in order to avoid underfilled sets
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> stopifnot(
   correctSetSize(8, 5) == 4
 )
 stopifnot(
   correctSetSize(101, 25) == 26
 )
 
</code></pre>
