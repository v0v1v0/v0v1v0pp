<h2>
Merge Allele Assignment Matrices
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In cases where multiple populations are used separately to assign
alleles to homeologous loci, <code>mergeAlleleAssignments</code> is used to
consolidate the results.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mergeAlleleAssignments(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>A list, where each element is in the format of results produced by
<code>catalanAlleles</code> or <code>testAlGroups</code>; see example.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list in similar format to <code>x</code>, but with only one element per locus.
</p>
