<h2>Calculate the index of association between samples in a genlight object.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function parses over a genlight object to calculate and return the index
of association for those samples.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bitwise.ia(x, missing_match = TRUE, differences_only = FALSE, threads = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a genlight or snpclone object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>missing_match</code></td>
<td>
<p>a boolean determining whether missing data should be
considered a match. If TRUE (default) missing data at a locus will match
with any data at that locus in each comparison. If FALSE, missing data at a
locus will cause all comparisons to return the maximum possible distance at
that locus (ie, if sample 1 has missing data at locus 1, and sample 2 is
heterozygous at locus 1, the distance at that locus will be 1. If sample 2
was heterozygous or missing at locus 1, the distance would be 2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>differences_only</code></td>
<td>
<p>a boolean determining how distance should be counted
for diploids. Whether TRUE or FALSE the distance between a heterozygous
locus and a homozygous locus is 1. If FALSE (default) the distance between
opposite homozygous loci is 2. If TRUE that distance counts as 1,
indicating only that the two samples differ at that locus.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threads</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum number of parallel threads to be used within this
function. A value of 0 (default) will attempt to use as many threads as
there are available cores/CPUs. In most cases this is ideal. A value of 1
will force the function to run serially, which may increase stability on
some systems. Other values may be specified, but should be used with
caution.</p>
