<h2>NASCAR Data (partial orderings)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The NASCAR dataset (<code>d_nascar</code>) collects the results of the 2002 season of stock car racing held in the United States. The 2002 championship consisted of <code class="reqn">N=36</code> races, with 43 car drivers competing in each race. A total of <code class="reqn">K=87</code> drivers participated in the 2002 season, taking part to a variable number of races: some of them competed in all the races, some others in only one. The results of the entire 2002 season were collected in the form of top-43 orderings, where the position of the not-competing drivers in each race is assumed lower than the 43th, but undetermined. Missing positions are denoted with zero entries.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(d_nascar)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Object of S3 class <code>c("top_ordering","matrix")</code> gathering a matrix of partial orderings with <code class="reqn">N=36</code> rows and <code class="reqn">K=87</code> columns. Each row lists the car drivers from the top position (<code>Rank_1</code>) to the bottom one (<code>Rank_87</code>) in a given race. Columns from the 44th to the 87th are filled with zeros, because only 43 drivers competed in each race.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(d_nascar)
head(d_nascar)

## Compute the number of races for each of the 87 drivers
table(c(d_nascar[,1:43]))

## Identify drivers arrived last (43th position) in all the races
which(colSums(rank_summaries(d_nascar, format="ordering")$marginals[1:42,])==0)

## Obscure drivers 84, 85, 86 and 87 to get the reduced dataset
