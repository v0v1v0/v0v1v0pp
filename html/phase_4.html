<h2>Generate actograms for sleep data (Somnograms)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates a composite figure with actograms (referred to as somnograms, here) for all flies in a DAM scanned monitor file. Input for this function must be an output from the trimData() function. The output of this function is a large plotly object. This function requires the packages "plotly" and "zoo".
In a particular bin, sleep is calculated as the total minutes of inactivity equal to or greater than the defined threshold (sleep.def; typically, 5-minutes).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">allSomnograms(
  data,
  sleep.def = c(5),
  bin = 30,
  t.cycle = 24,
  color = rgb(0, 0, 0, 1)
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Input data file. The input for this function must be the output of the function trimData(). See ??trimData().</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sleep.def</code></td>
<td>
<p>Definition of sleep. Traditionally, a single bout of sleep is defined as any duration of inactivity that is equal to or greater than 5-minutes. However, sometimes it may be of interest to examine longer bouts of sleep or specific bout durations; sleep.def allows users to change the definition of sleep. The default input is a single value vector of value 5. If users wish to analyse sleep only between 5 to 20 mins, the input must be c(5,20).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bin</code></td>
<td>
<p>Intervals in which data are saved (in minutes). This defaults to 30. The value of bin cannot be lower than that of sleep.def.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>t.cycle</code></td>
<td>
<p>Define the period of the environmental cycle or a single day in hours. This defaults to 24.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>color</code></td>
<td>
<p>Color of somnograms in rgb format. The input for this must be a vector with 4 values, i.e., r,g,b,transparency. The values for r,g,b can only be between 0 and 1. 0,0,0 would be black and 1,1,1 would be white. Transparency values can also go from 0 to 1, 0 being fully transparent and 1 being fully opaque.</p>
