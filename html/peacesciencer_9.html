<h2>Add Correlates of War trade data to a data frame</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_cow_trade()</code> allows you to add Correlates of War trade data to your
(dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year, state-year) data frame
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_cow_trade(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with appropriate <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> attributes</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For the dyad-year (and leader-dyad-year) data, there must be some kind of information loss in order to work within the
limited space available to this package. This package loads a truncated version of the data in which the trade
values are rounded to three decimal points in order to greatly reduce the disk space for this package. I do not think this
to be terribly problematic, though I admit I do not like it. If this is a problem for your research question,
you may want to consider not using this function for dyad-year or leader-dyad-year data.
</p>
<p>Be mindful that the data are fundamentally state-year or dyad-year and that extensions to leader-level data should be understood
as approximations for leaders (leader-dyads) in a given state-year (dyad-year).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_cow_trade()</code> takes a (dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year, state-year) data frame and
adds information about the volume of trade in that given dyad-year or state-year. For the state-year (leader-year)
data, these are minimally the sum of all imports and the sum of all exports. For dyad-year (leader-dyad-year) data,
this function returns the value of imports in current million USD in the first country from
the second country (and vice-versa) along with their "smooth" equivalents.
