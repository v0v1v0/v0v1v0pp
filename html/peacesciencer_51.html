<h2>Create leader-dyad-years from the Archigos data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>create_leaderdyadyears()</code> allows you to created leader dyad-year data from the
Archigos data first introduced and described by Goemans et al. (2009).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">create_leaderdyadyears(directed = TRUE, system = "gw")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>directed</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, defaults to TRUE. If TRUE, the function returns so-called
"directed" leader dyad-year data. If FALSE, the function returns
non-directed data where the state codes for the second leader are all greater than
the state codes for the second leader.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>system</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character specifying whether the user wants Correlates of War
state-years ("cow") or Gleditsch-Ward ("gw") state-years. Gleditsch-Ward is the
default.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is a <em>complete</em> and <em>universal</em> leader dyad-year data frame for all possible dyadic
leader pairings from 1870 to 2015. This has several implications. First: these data are enormous. The
output is over 2 million rows long! Second: the time required to create these data from scratch would
take too long for a normal function call. This amounts to an unholy combination of data that are too large
for CRAN's disk space restrictions (5 MB) and too time-consuming to do from scratch every time. Thus, the
data are pre-generated and stored remotely. Check <code>download_extdata()</code> for more information.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>create_leaderdyadyears()</code> takes remote data available for separate download
and returns a complete leader dyad-year data frame for all leaders, and all possible dyads,
from 1870 to 2015.
