<h2>Run search and performance evaluation with cross-validation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Run the <em>search</em> part and the <em>evaluation</em> part for a projection predictive
variable selection. The search part determines the predictor ranking (also
known as solution path), i.e., the best submodel for each submodel size
(number of predictor terms). The evaluation part determines the predictive
performance of the submodels along the predictor ranking. In contrast to
<code>varsel()</code>, <code>cv_varsel()</code> performs a cross-validation (CV) by running the
search part with the training data of each CV fold separately (an exception
is explained in section "Note" below) and by running the evaluation part on
the corresponding test set of each CV fold. A special method is
<code>cv_varsel.vsel()</code> because it re-uses the search results from an earlier
<code>cv_varsel()</code> (or <code>varsel()</code>) run, as illustrated in the main vignette.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>refmodel</code> (returned by <code>get_refmodel()</code> or
<code>init_refmodel()</code>) or an object that can be passed to argument <code>object</code> of
<code>get_refmodel()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>For <code>cv_varsel.default()</code>: Arguments passed to <code>get_refmodel()</code> as
well as to <code>cv_varsel.refmodel()</code>. For <code>cv_varsel.vsel()</code>: Arguments passed
to <code>cv_varsel.refmodel()</code>. For <code>cv_varsel.refmodel()</code>: Arguments passed to
the divergence minimizer (see argument <code>div_minimizer</code> of <code>init_refmodel()</code>
as well as section "Draw-wise divergence minimizers" of projpred-package)
when refitting the submodels for the performance evaluation (if <code>refit_prj</code>
is <code>TRUE</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cv_method</code></td>
<td>
<p>The CV method, either <code>"LOO"</code> or <code>"kfold"</code>. In the <code>"LOO"</code>
case, a Pareto-smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out CV (PSIS-LOO CV)
is performed, which avoids refitting the reference model <code>nloo</code> times (in
contrast to a standard LOO CV). In the <code>"kfold"</code> case, a <code class="reqn">K</code>-fold CV is
performed. See also section "Note" below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nloo</code></td>
<td>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> Still experimental. Only relevant if <code>cv_method = "LOO"</code>. If <code>nloo</code> is smaller than the number of all observations,
approximate full LOO CV using probability-proportional-to-size-sampling
(PPS) to make accurate computation only for <code>nloo</code> (anything from 1 to the
number of all observations) leave-one-out folds (Magnusson et al., 2019).
Smaller values lead to faster computation but higher uncertainty in the
evaluation part. If <code>NULL</code>, all observations are used (as by default).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>K</code></td>
<td>
<p>Only relevant if <code>cv_method = "kfold"</code> and if <code>cvfits</code> is <code>NULL</code>
(which is the case for reference model objects created by
<code>get_refmodel.stanreg()</code> or <code>brms::get_refmodel.brmsfit()</code>). Number of
folds in <code class="reqn">K</code>-fold CV.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cvfits</code></td>
<td>
<p>Only relevant if <code>cv_method = "kfold"</code>. The same as argument

<code>run_cvfun()</code> can be inserted here straightforwardly.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>validate_search</code></td>
<td>
<p>A single logical value indicating whether to
cross-validate also the search part, i.e., whether to run the search
separately for each CV fold (<code>TRUE</code>) or not (<code>FALSE</code>). We strongly do not
recommend setting this to <code>FALSE</code>, because this is known to bias the
predictive performance estimates of the selected submodels. However,
setting this to <code>FALSE</code> can sometimes be useful because comparing the
results to the case where this argument is <code>TRUE</code> gives an idea of how
strongly the search is (over-)fitted to the data (the difference
corresponds to the search degrees of freedom or the effective number of
parameters introduced by the search).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Arguments <code>ndraws</code>, <code>nclusters</code>, <code>nclusters_pred</code>, and <code>ndraws_pred</code>
are automatically truncated at the number of posterior draws in the
reference model (which is <code>1</code> for <code>datafit</code>s). Using less draws or clusters
in <code>ndraws</code>, <code>nclusters</code>, <code>nclusters_pred</code>, or <code>ndraws_pred</code> than posterior
draws in the reference model may result in slightly inaccurate projection
performance. Increasing these arguments affects the computation time
linearly.
</p>
<p>For argument <code>method</code>, there are some restrictions: For a reference model
with multilevel or additive formula terms or a reference model set up for
the augmented-data projection, only the forward search is available.
Furthermore, argument <code>search_terms</code> requires a forward search to take
effect.
</p>
<p>L1 search is faster than forward search, but forward search may be more
accurate. Furthermore, forward search may find a sparser model with
comparable performance to that found by L1 search, but it may also start
overfitting when more predictors are added.
</p>
<p>An L1 search may select an interaction term before all involved lower-order
interaction terms (including main-effect terms) have been selected. In
<span class="pkg">projpred</span> versions &gt; 2.6.0, the resulting predictor ranking is
automatically modified so that the lower-order interaction terms come
before this interaction term, but if this is conceptually undesired, choose
the forward search instead.
</p>
<p>The elements of the <code>search_terms</code> character vector don't need to be
individual predictor terms. Instead, they can be building blocks consisting
of several predictor terms connected by the <code>+</code> symbol. To understand how
these building blocks work, it is important to know how <span class="pkg">projpred</span>'s
forward search works: It starts with an empty vector <code>chosen</code> which will
later contain already selected predictor terms. Then, the search iterates
over model sizes <code class="reqn">j \in \{0, ..., J\}</code> (with <code class="reqn">J</code>
denoting the maximum submodel size, not counting the intercept). The
candidate models at model size <code class="reqn">j</code> are constructed from those elements
from <code>search_terms</code> which yield model size <code class="reqn">j</code> when combined with the
<code>chosen</code> predictor terms. Note that sometimes, there may be no candidate
models for model size <code class="reqn">j</code>. Also note that internally, <code>search_terms</code> is
expanded to include the intercept (<code>"1"</code>), so the first step of the search
(model size 0) always consists of the intercept-only model as the only
candidate.
</p>
<p>As a <code>search_terms</code> example, consider a reference model with formula <code>y ~ x1 + x2 + x3</code>. Then, to ensure that <code>x1</code> is always included in the
candidate models, specify <code>search_terms = c("x1", "x1 + x2", "x1 + x3", "x1 + x2 + x3")</code> (or, in a simpler way that leads to the same results,
<code>search_terms = c("x1", "x1 + x2", "x1 + x3")</code>, for which helper function
<code>force_search_terms()</code> exists). This search would start with <code>y ~ 1</code> as the
only candidate at model size 0. At model size 1, <code>y ~ x1</code> would be the only
candidate. At model size 2, <code>y ~ x1 + x2</code> and <code>y ~ x1 + x3</code> would be the
two candidates. At the last model size of 3, <code>y ~ x1 + x2 + x3</code> would be
the only candidate. As another example, to exclude <code>x1</code> from the search,
specify <code>search_terms = c("x2", "x3", "x2 + x3")</code> (or, in a simpler way
that leads to the same results, <code>search_terms = c("x2", "x3")</code>).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>vsel</code>. The elements of this object are not meant
to be accessed directly but instead via helper functions (see the main
vignette and projpred-package).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>If <code>validate_search</code> is <code>FALSE</code>, the search is not included in the CV
so that only a single full-data search is run.
</p>
<p>For PSIS-LOO CV, <span class="pkg">projpred</span> calls <code>loo::psis()</code> (or, exceptionally,
<code>loo::sis()</code>, see below) with <code>r_eff = NA</code>. This is only a problem if there
was extreme autocorrelation between the MCMC iterations when the reference
model was built. In those cases however, the reference model should not
have been used anyway, so we don't expect <span class="pkg">projpred</span>'s <code>r_eff = NA</code> to
be a problem.
</p>
<p>PSIS cannot be used if the draws have different (i.e., nonconstant) weights
or if the number of draws is too small. In such cases, <span class="pkg">projpred</span>
resorts to standard importance sampling (SIS) and throws a warning about
this. Throughout the documentation, the term "PSIS" is used even though in
fact, <span class="pkg">projpred</span> resorts to SIS in these special cases.
</p>
<p>With <code>parallel = TRUE</code>, costly parts of <span class="pkg">projpred</span>'s CV are run in
parallel. Costly parts are the fold-wise searches and performance
evaluations in case of <code>validate_search = TRUE</code>. (Note that in case of
<code class="reqn">K</code>-fold CV, the <code class="reqn">K</code> reference model refits are not affected by
argument <code>parallel</code>; only <span class="pkg">projpred</span>'s CV is affected.) The
parallelization is powered by the <span class="pkg">foreach</span> package. Thus, any parallel
(or sequential) backend compatible with <span class="pkg">foreach</span> can be used, e.g.,
the backends from packages <span class="pkg">doParallel</span>, <span class="pkg">doMPI</span>, or
<span class="pkg">doFuture</span>. For GLMs, this CV parallelization should work reliably, but
for other models (such as GLMMs), it may lead to excessive memory usage
which in turn may crash the R session (on Unix systems, setting an
appropriate memory limit via <code>unix::rlimit_as()</code> may avoid crashing the
whole machine). However, the problem of excessive memory usage is less
pronounced for the CV parallelization than for the projection
parallelization described in projpred-package. In that regard, the CV
parallelization is recommended over the projection parallelization.
