<h2>Bedrest Marking, Universal</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Processes data from (Actigraph) accelerometers and classifies each epoch as either bedrest or active. The output contains an additional (compared to input) "Bedrest" column. The column has a return of "a" for activity or "br" for bedrest in each line (i.e. epoch). An additional option allows for a nap ("n") classification. The "n" differs from "br" only in how long the bedrest period is. The nap cutoff is specifiable, see below. The function is designed to be used after wearingMarking function in the Physical Activity package.
</p>
<p>Like activity level cut points vary depending upon the age of the person wearing the accelerometer and the body location it was worn, the function requires arguments calibrated to the wearer and location.   These may be specified in one of two ways: 1) enter arguments for age and location (loc)., or 2) enter arguments for TH, wd and nvm.  These are described briefly below.  See Tracy et al. (2014) for a more detailed explanation.  We have calibrated for waist and wrist in adults (19-64) and youth (10-18) and waist for preschoolers (3-5).   Adult and Youth calibrations were on <b>Axis1</b>.  Preschooler calibrations were on <b>VM</b>.  All calibrations are for <b>1 minute</b> epoch data.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Designed to be used after the wearingMarking function in the PhysicalActivity package is applied to identify accelerometer nonwear time intervals from the dataset. In addition to the dataframe, the function also generates a csv file with columns for the beginning and end time points of intervals classified as bedrest. These files could be read and merged into batch files and reviewed for accuracy. 
</p>
<p>Data should be in 1 minute epochs. 
</p>
<p>The values the various age-loc combinations called maximized (sensitivity * specificity) Axis1 data. The youth study is described in Tracy et al. (2014). The values can be changed to investigator-selected values (e.g. threshold for maximum number of counts). If appropriate values for TH, wd, nvm and per were available, the functions could process data from accelerometers worn at other locations (e.g. ankle) or other populations (e.g. seniors), vector magnitude (VM) could be specified as the counts column (cts) data obtained from triaxial accelerometer. 
</p>
<p>Note: nmin and nmax work in tandem.  Setting them equal, as is the default does returns no nap intervals.  To mark naps differently than other Bedrest,  nmin must be less than nmax, e.g. 60 and 120 minutes, respectively.  If this is the case, time intervals below the 60 min threshold (nmin) are classified as activity ("a"), those between 60 and 120 min are classified as nap ("n"), and those greater than 120 min (nmax) are classified as bedtime rest ("br").</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with an additional column, "BedRest".  Bedrest will return "br" for bedtime rest and "a" activity in each line.  Options also allow for "n" nap which only differ than "br" in being for a shorter (specifiable) time period.</p>

## Not run: wr_ad_lb1499 = read.csv("wr_ad_lb1499.csv")
    wr_ad_lb1499_slp = markbedrest(dset=wr_ad_lb1499, age="ad", loc="wr"
                                   , rstdr = tempdir()
    ## previous line is only included to comply with CRAN policies
                                   )

##	Example 2 (transforms data set to demonstrate other arguments):  
    alt_wr_ad_lb1499 = wr_ad_lb1499
    colnames(alt_wr_ad_lb1499) = c("tstmp", "Counts")

alt_wr_ad_lb1499_slp = markbedrest(dset = alt_wr_ad_lb1499,
                                   TS = "tstmp", 
                                   cts = "Counts", 
                                   TH = 400,
                                   wd = 1500,
                                   nvm = 150,

                                   rstfl = "alt_wr_ad_lb1499_sum",
                                   EC = FALSE)
