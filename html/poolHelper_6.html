<h2>Filter sites according to a minor-allele reads threshold</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Removes sites from matrices with counts of reads. If a site has less
minor-allele reads than <code>min.minor</code> across all populations, that site is
removed from the data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">filterMinor(reference, alternative, coverage, min.minor)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reference</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix with the number of reads with the reference allele.
Each row should be a different population and each column a different site.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alternative</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix with the number of reads with the alternative
allele. Each row should be a different population and each column a
different site.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>coverage</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a matrix of total coverage. Each row of the matrix should
be a different population and each column a different site. Thus, each
entry of the matrix contains the total number of observed reads for that
population at a given site.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min.minor</code></td>
<td>
<p>is an integer representing the minimum allowed number of
minor-allele reads. Sites that, across all populations, have less
minor-allele reads than this threshold will be removed from the data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list with three named entries:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reference</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list with one entry per locus. Each entry is a matrix with
the number of reference allele reads. Each column represents a different site.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alternative</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list with one entry per locus. Each entry is a matrix with
the number of alternative allele reads. Each column represents a different site.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>total</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list with one entry per locus. Each entry is a matrix with
the total depth of coverage. Each column represents a different site.</p>
</td>
</tr>
