<h2>East Coast Fever transmission dynamics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><em>Theileriosis</em> or East Coast Fever (ECF) is a major cattle disease 
in East and Southern Africa. 
The disease is caused by <em>Theileria parva</em> which is transmitted by the ticks
<em>Rhipicephalus appendiculatus</em> and the closely related
<em>Rhipicephalus zambeziensis</em>.
</p>
<p>In order to study the transmission of the disease, cows were followed up 
from birth until time of first ECF contact in Nteme, 
a region in Southern Zambia. 
On weekly basis, blood is collected and tested for the presence of antibodies 
to <em>Theileria parva</em> using the Indirect Fluorescent Antibody test. 
After three consecutive positive IFA test results an animal 
is considered seroconverted.
The time to first ECF contact is defined as the timespan from birth 
to one month before the first of the three consecutive positive test results 
(i.e., we set the date of contact with <em>Theileria parva</em> one month before 
the time of the first positive test result). 
Animals are followed up until one year after birth; if they do not seroconvert 
by that time, their time of seroconversion is right-censored. 
We also consider the binary covariate breed.
