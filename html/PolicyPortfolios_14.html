<h2>Complete a policy portfolio</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Complete an already tidy dataset with the full set of instruments, targets and years.
Used also to specify the order of instruments and targets.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pp_complete(
  D,
  year.range = NULL,
  Instrument.set = NULL,
  Target.set = NULL,
  date = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>D</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame in a tidy format with the following columns: "Country", "Sector", "Year", "Instrument", "Target" and "covered". "covered" is a binary identificator of whether the portfolio space is covered by policy intervention (1) or not (0). The remaining columns identify the case. Notice that "Year" is a numeric value, while the remaining 4 case identifiers are factors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>year.range</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numerical vector of length two with the initial and final value of the years considered</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Instrument.set</code></td>
<td>
<p>Ordered factor with the full set of values of Instruments, to be combined with the already existing Instruments.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Target.set</code></td>
<td>
<p>Ordered factor with the full set of values of Targets, to be combined with the already existing Targets.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>date</code></td>
<td>
<p>By default a portfolio by every year is employed. Otherwise, use a full date (DD-MM-YYYY).</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>D Data frame in a tidy format with the following columns: "Country", "Sector", "Year", "Instrument", "Target" and "covered". "covered" is a binary identificator of whether the portfolio space is covered by policy intervention (1) or not (0). The remaining columns identify the case. Notice that "Year" is a numeric value, while the remaining 4 case identifiers are factors. It differs from the input in that this one includes the full set of pre-specified Instruments, Targets and temporal range.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(P.education)
range(P.education$Year)

P.education.full &lt;- pp_complete(P.education, year.range = c(2000, 2035))
range(P.education.full$Year)
</code></pre>
