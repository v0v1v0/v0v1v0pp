<h2>Simulation of a manufacturing facility's profit when varying two factors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The hourly profit made when selling the product at price <code>P</code> and the product is produced
at a throughput rate <code>T</code> [parts per hour].</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">manufacture(P=0.75, T=325)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>P</code></td>
<td>

<p>the selling price of the product. The default amount, if unspecified, is $0.75.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>T</code></td>
<td>

<p>the production rate (throughput), measured in parts per hour. The default value, if unspecified, is 325 parts per hour.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function simulates the hourly profit in a manufacturing facility.<br>
Two factors can be adjusted by the user to determine the optimum:
</p>

<ul>
<li>   <p><code>P</code>: The selling price of the product (must be a positive value).
</p>
</li>
<li>   <p><code>T</code>: The production rate, also called throughput (must be a positive value).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you determine the best combination of conditions, using a systematic method (i.e. not by trial and error)? More defects are created
when production rates are too high.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns the hourly profit made. Random noise is added for some realism.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Producing at the default settings of price ($0.75)
# and throughput of 325 parts per hour:
manufacture()

# Let's try selling for a higher price, $1.05,
# and a slower throughput of 298 parts per hour:
manufacture(P=1.05, T=298)

# What happens if the product is sold too cheaply
# at high production rates?
manufacture(P=0.52, T=417)

# Can you find the optimum combination of settings to
# maximize the profit, but using only a few experiments?
