<h2>CSP-SegPseP-SegACP feature vector</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This feature vector is constructed  by fusing consensus sequence (CS), segmented PsePSSM, and
segmented auto-covariance transformation (ACT) based on PSSM. by consensus sequence a 40-dimensional feature
vector is obtained, in segmented PsePSSM group, by dividing PSSM Matrix to 2 and 3 segments a 380-dimensional
feature vector is obtained and in ACT group, similar to the previous group at first PSSM Matrix is divided
to 2 and 3 segments then a feature vector of length 280 is obtained.eventually by fusing these features a
700-dimensional feature vector is obtained.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">CS_PSe_PSSM(pssm_name, vec_name)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pssm_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>name of PSSM Matrix file</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vec_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character that user imports to specify kind of feature vector which it can be varied between
four values</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If vec_name equals to "segmented_psepssm" then a feature vector of length 380 is obtained.
if vec_name equals to "segmented_acpssm" then a feature vector of length 280 is obtained, and if vec_name
equals to "cspssm" the obtained feature vector would be of length 40 eventually if vec_name equals to
"total" then feature vector would be of length 700.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>feature vector that its length depends on the vec_name which user imports. vec_name can be one
of "cspssm", "segmented_psepssm", "segmented_acpssm", "total".
