<h2>Estimate average causal effects by propensity score weighting for a binary treatment with clustering.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function <code>PSweight_cl</code> is used to estimate the average potential outcomes corresponding to
each treatment group among the target population with two-level data. The function currently implements
the following types of weights: the inverse probability of treatment weights (IPW: target population is the combined population),
average treatment effect among the treated weights (treated: target population is the population receiving a specified treatment),
overlap weights (overlap: target population is the overlap population at clinical equipoise), matching weights (matching: target population
is population obtained under 1:1 matching), entropy weights (entropy: target population is the population weighted by the entropy function).
Augmented propensity score weighting estimators are also allowed, with propensity scores and outcome model estimated
within the function through mixed effect model.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A typical form for <code>ps.formula</code> is <code>treatment ~ terms+1|clusters</code> where <code>treatment</code> is the treatment
variable  and <code>terms</code> is a series of terms
which specifies a linear predictor for <code>treatment</code> and cluster level effects. Similarly, a typical form for <code>out.formula</code> is
<code>outcome ~ treatment+terms+1|cluster</code> where <code>outcome</code> is the outcome variable (identical to the variable name
used to specify <code>yname</code>); <code>terms</code> is a series of terms which specifies a linear
predictor for <code>outcome</code>; <code>clusters</code> is the random effects term for clusters. Both <code>ps.formula</code> and <code>out.formula</code> by default specify generalized
linear mixed effect models.
</p>
<p>Current version of <code>PSweight_cl</code> allows for five types of propensity score weights used to estimate ATE (IPW), ATT (treated) and
ATO (overlap), ATM (matching) and ATEN (entropy). These weights are members of larger class of balancing weights defined in Li, Morgan, and Zaslavsky (2018).
Specific definitions of these weights are provided in Li, Morgan, and Zaslavsky (2018), Li and Greene (2013), Zhou, Matsouaka and Thomas (2020).
When there is a practical violation of the positivity assumption, <code>delta</code> defines the symmetric
propensity score trimming rule following Crump et al. (2009). The overlap weights can also be considered as
a data-driven continuous trimming strategy without specifying trimming rules, see Li, Thomas and Li (2019).
Additional details on balancing weights and generalized overlap weights for multiple treatment groups are provided in
Li and Li (2019).
</p>
<p>If <code>augmentation = TRUE</code>, an augmented weighting estimator will be implemented. For binary treatments, the augmented
weighting estimator is presented in Mao, Li and Greene (2018). When
<code>weight = "IPW"</code>, the augmented estimator is also referred to as a doubly-robust (DR) estimator.
</p>
<p>When <code>bootstrap = TRUE</code>, the variance will be calculated by nonparametric bootstrap, with <code>R</code> bootstrap
replications. <code>bs_level</code> needs to be specified as the variable name for the cluster in order to conduct cluster
level resampling and maintaining the cluster level coorelation. The default value <code>NULL</code> treat each observation independently.
The default of <code>R</code> is 50. Otherwise, the variance will be calculated using the sandwich variance
formula obtained in the M-estimation framework.
</p>
