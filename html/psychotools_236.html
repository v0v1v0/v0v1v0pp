<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The gratitude scales employed are:<br>
GRAT: Gratitude, Resentment, Appreciation Test (1–9).<br>
Short form with subscales LOSD (lack of a sense of deprivation),
SA (simple appreciation), and AO (appreciation for others).<br>
GQ-6: Gratitude Questionnaire-6 (1–7).<br>
GAC: Gratitude Adjective Checklist (1–5).
</p>
<p>The item <code>losd_1</code> has been omitted from all analyses in Froh et al. (2011)
because it loaded lowly on all factors. Hence <code>losd_1</code> is not listed in
Table B1 of Froh et al. (2011). Instead, the remaining items are labeled
<code>losd_1</code> to <code>losd_5</code>.
