<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function exports the custom environment 'RCircos.Env' used by <span class="pkg">RCircos</span>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">PACVr</span> employs <span class="pkg">RCircos</span> as its visualization engine. In its operation, <span class="pkg">RCircos</span> defines a custom environment (called 'RCircos.Env') and reads/writes variables to this environment from various of its functions. In order to make this environment accessible to <span class="pkg">RCircos</span> within <span class="pkg">PACVr</span> and, simultaneously, fulfil the requirements of CRAN, this export command was created.
