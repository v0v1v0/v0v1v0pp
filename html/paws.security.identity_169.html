<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cloudhsmv2_initialize_cluster(ClusterId, SignedCert, TrustAnchor)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ClusterId</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The identifier (ID) of the cluster that you are claiming. To find the

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
