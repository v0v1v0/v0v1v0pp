<h2>Spectra acquired with LI-COR LI-1800</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Lamp emission spectra measured with a LI-COR LI-1800 
spectroradiometer. Member spectra containing the wavelengths at a 0.5 nm, 
1.0 nm, or 2.0 nm interval and tabulated values of spectral irradiance for 
different lamps. As absolute values are not meaningful because measuring 
distances are in most cases unknown data have been normalized to one at the
wavelength of maximum energy irradiance.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A vector of character strings.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>licor</code> is a character vector with indexes to members of 
<code>lamps.mspct</code>
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Instrument used: LI-COR LI1800 scanning single monochromator 
spectroradiometer with a cosine corrected input optics. Recently calibrated
with a LI-COR calibration lamp. Measurements done by Pedro J. Aphalo 
between 1992 and 2001.
