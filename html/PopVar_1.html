<h2>Genomic breeding tools to 1) predict standard statistics and correlated response in plant populations, and 2) performs cross-validation to estimate genome-wide prediction accuracy</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>PopVar includes two functions useful for genome-based breeding: </p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>pop.predict</code> uses phenotypic and genotypic data from a set of individuals known as a training population (TP) and a set of candidate parents, which may or may not be included in the TP, to predict the mean (<code class="reqn">\mu</code>), genetic variance (<em>V_G</em>), and superior progeny value (<code class="reqn">\mu</code><em>_sp</em>) of the half-diallel, or a defined set of pairwise bi-parental crosses between parents. When multiple traits are provided <code>pop.predict</code> will also predict the correlated responses and correlation between all pairwise traits. See <cite>Mohammadi, Tiede, and Smith (2015)</cite> for further details.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>x.val</code> performs cross-validation (CV) to estimate the accuracy of genome-wide prediction (otherwise known as genomic selection) for a specific training population (TP), i.e. a set of individuals for which phenotypic and genotypic data is available. Cross-validation can be conducted via one of two methods, see <code>Details</code> in <code>x.val</code> documentation for more information.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The dataset <code>think_barley.rda</code>, previously described in <cite>Sallam et al. (2014)</cite>, is provided as an example of the proper formatting of input files and also for users to become familiar with the functions within <code>PopVar</code>.
