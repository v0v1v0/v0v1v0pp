<h2>Estimate Sampling Rate from Sampling Horizon Data (Solow and Smith, 1997)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function implements the exact maximum likelihood estimator for the
instantaneous sampling rate from Solow and Smith (1997, Paleobiology),
which is based on the relationship between the number of collections for a
set of taxa and their durations (known precisely in continuous time).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">horizonSampRate(sampOcc = NULL, durations = NULL, nCollections = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sampOcc</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list with the number of elements equal to the number of taxa,
and each element of the list being a numerical vector with the length equal
to the number of collections for each taxon, and each value equal to the
precise date of that fossil's time of collection. These dates do not need
to be ordered. If not supplied, the elements <code>durations</code> and <code>nCollections</code> must
be supplied.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>durations</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of precise durations in continuous time, with the
length equal to the number of taxa. If not supplied, this is calculated from
<code>SampOcc</code>, which must be supplied.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nCollections</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of integers representing the number of
collections for each taxon in the input durations. If not supplied
this is calculated from <code>SampOcc</code>, which must be supplied.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Given a dataset of taxa with a vector <code class="reqn">N</code>, representing the number of
collections for each taxon, and a vector <code class="reqn">D</code>, giving the precise duration
for each taxon, we can use the following maximum likelihood estimator from
Solow and Smith (1997) to obtain the instantaneous sampling rate:
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">samplingRate = (sum(N-1)^2)/(sum(D)*sum(N))</code>
</p>
<p>This method is exclusively for datasets with very precisely dated horizons,
such as microfossils from deep sea cores with very precise age models. The
first and last appearance must be known very precisely to provide an equally
precise estimate of the duration. Most datasets are not precise enough
for this method, due to chronostratigraphic uncertainty. However, note that the age
of individual collections other than the first and last appearance dates
do not need to be known: its only the number of collections that matters.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns the instantaneous sampling (in per lineage*time-units) as a
single numerical value. Note that this is the instantaneous sampling
rate and not the probability of sampling a taxon per interval.

ranges alone to estimate sampling parameters, implemented in

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">#can simulate this type of data with sampleRanges
    # just set ranges.only = FALSE
#let's try a simulation example:
set.seed(444)
record &lt;- simFossilRecord(p = 0.1, q = 0.1, nruns = 1,
	nTotalTaxa = c(30,40), nExtant = 0)
taxa &lt;- fossilRecord2fossilTaxa(record)
sampledOccurrences &lt;- sampleRanges(taxa,r = 0.5,ranges.only = FALSE)

# now try with horizonSampRate
horizonSampRate(sampOcc = sampledOccurrences)

# but we could also try with the *other* inputs
   # useful because some datasets we may only have durations
   # and number of sampling events for
filtered &lt;- sampledOccurrences[!is.na(sampledOccurrences)] 
dur &lt;- sapply(filtered,max) - sapply(filtered,min)
nCol &lt;- sapply(filtered,length)
# supply as durations and nCollections
horizonSampRate(durations = dur, nCollections = nCol)
