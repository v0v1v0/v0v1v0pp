<h2>Compute mean expected heterozygosity within a population</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This functions calculates the value of the expected heterozygosity for each
site and then computes the mean of those values in order to obtain the mean
expected heterozygosity within each population.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">meanExpected_Het(Pop_Pi)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Pop_Pi</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a matrix or list of allele frequencies. When dealing with a
single locus, this input is a matrix and when dealing with multiple loci it
is a list. Each entry of that list is a matrix representing a different
locus. Each row of that matrix should correspond to a different population
and each column to a different SNP.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>if the input is a single matrix, the output will be a vector where
the first entry is the mean expected heterozygosity of the first population
and the n entry is the mean expected heterozygosity of the nth population.
If the input is a list, the output will also be a list, with each entry
corresponding to a different locus. Each of those entries will be a vector
with the mean expected heterozygosity per population for that locus.
