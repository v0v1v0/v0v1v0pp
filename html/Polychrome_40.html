<h3>Source</h3>

<p>Spectral karyotyping is a standard cytogenetic technology to map
chromosomes using multiple different colored fluorescent probes. The
probes for each individual human chromosome use different combinations
of one or more probes. The standard software to display the result
uses a false-color mapping to a 24-color paletee. Coombes et al. (see
references) showed that the common colorm palette includes several
colors that are hard to distinguish, then genrated this palette as a
suggested replacement. The copde to generate the palette (and to match
it as closely as possible with the older standard) can be found inth e
appendix to that paper
