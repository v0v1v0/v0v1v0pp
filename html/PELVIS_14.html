<h2>
An R-Shiny application for the sex estimation of the human os coxae
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Launches a graphical user interface (GUI) allowing to use Bruzek's
methods (2002, 2019) for sexing the human os coxae, based on eleven
visual traits.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">start_pelvis()

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The R-Shiny application proposes two tabs:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p>‘Data input: manual editing’ can be used for both data
entry and sex classification. The eleven trichotomic traits are
manually edited for each os coxae through the GUI, and the
corresponding sex estimates are then produced.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘Data input: from text file’ is the classical way to
get the sex estimates for a whole sample of ossa coxae correctly
described in a file. PELVIS accepts .CSV or .TXT data files, but
does not support .ODS or .XLS(X) files. The predictive factors
(i.e. the eleven trichotomic traits) should have the same headers
and levels as in the reference dataset ‘refData’ included in
PELVIS. An example of valid data file can be found on Zenodo:
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2586897">doi:10.5281/zenodo.2586897</a> (its field separator is
the semicolon ";").
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In both tabs, two sex estimates are given: the visual sex estimate
from Bruzek (2002), and the probabilistic sex estimate from Santos,
Guyomarc'h, Rmoutilova and Bruzek (2019). Depending on the traits
possibly missing on the ossa coxae submitted to the program, the
logistic regression models can use various subsets of best predictors
(selected by AIC or BIC), or all predictors. The final subset of
predictors used for each os coxae is given in the table of results.
The user may also want to define a posterior probability threshold for
sex estimation (0.90 or 0.95): any os coxae that does not reach this
threshold will remain indeterminate.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns no value by itself, but the results can be
downloaded through the graphical interface. The table of results
includes the following columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p>‘Sex estimate (Bruzek 2002)’: the visual sex estimate
based on Bruzek's method (2002).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘Statistical sex estimate (2019)’: a sex estimation
based on a logistic regression model, following the method described
in Santos, Guyomarc'h, Rmoutilova and Bruzek (2019, submitted).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘Prob(M)’ is the probability (obtained with the
logistic regression model) that the individual is a man. According
to tradition in biological anthropology, we have the following
decsion rule: if Prob(M)&gt;0.95 then the sex estimate is ‘M’;
if Prob(M)&lt;0.05 then the sex estimate is ‘F’; else the
individual remains indeterminate (‘I’).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘Prob(F)’, defined as 1-Prob(M), is the probability
that the individual is a woman.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘Selected predictors in LR model’: for a given
individual, the sex estimation proceeds as follows. First, a
complete model is built using all available (i.e., nonmissing)
traits for this individual. Then, a classical stepwise model
selection by BIC is performed, and the subset of the most useful
traits is used to produce the final sex estimate. This column gives
the traits used for each individual.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘10-fold CV accuracy (%)’: the rate of correct
classification for the corresponding logistic regression model is
estimated using a ten-fold cross-validation on the learning sample.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘Indet. rate in CV (%)’: the rate of individuals
remaining indeterminate in cross-validation for the corresponding
logistic regression model.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The R console is not available when the GUI is active. To exit the GUI,
type Echap (on MS Windows systems) or Ctrl+C (on Linux systems) in the R
console.
</p>
<p>Regardless of the size and resolution of your screen, for convenience,
it is advisable to decrease the zoom level of your web browser and/or to
turn on fullscreen mode.
