<h2>
Phylogenetic Landscape Interpolation.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides functions for the spatial interpolation
of genetic distances between samples. The interpolation is
based on a modified kriging method that accepts a genetic
distance matrix and generates a map of probability of lineage
presence. This package also offers tools to generate a map of
potential contact zones between groups with user-defined
thresholds in the tree to account for old and recent
divergence. Additionally, it has functions for IDW
interpolation using genetic data and midpoints.

<p>The kriging algorithm uses a model fitted to the semi-variogram to weight
the values of the samples. Here the variogram was modified to fit a
model with pairwise comparison between genetic and real distances,
describing the spatial dependence in the genetic distance between samples.
A map for the lineage can be generated using only a vector that define if
each point belong to the a lineage or not.
</p>
<p>Since version 2.0, the kriging interpolation can be performed taking
into consideration a cost distance instead of simple geographical
distances between points. This can help in cases where a landscape
resistance explains better the genetic distances between samples
than the geographic distances alone.
</p>
<p>The IDW can be used to interpolate the genetic distance of each sample
against the others, or to interpolate genetic diverge at midpoints between
samples. The interpolated value at certain location is obtained by
weighting with the distances to the avaialable samples. Similarly to
kriging, these distance can be based on a cost distance calculation.
