<h2>Add fractionalization/polarization estimates from CREG to a data frame</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_creg_fractionalization()</code> allows you to add information about the
fractionalization/polarization of a state's ethnic and religious groups to
your data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_creg_fractionalization(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with appropriate <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> attributes</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Please see the information for the underlying data <code>creg</code>,
and the associated R script in the <code>data-raw</code> directory, to see how
these data are generated.
</p>
<p>The <code>creg</code> data have a few duplicates. When standardizing to true CoW
codes, the duplicates concern Serbia/Yugoslavia in 1991 and 1992 as well as
Russia/the Soviet Union in 1991. When standardizing to true Gleditsch-Ward
codes, the duplicates concern Serbia/Yugoslavia in 1991 and Russia/Soviet
Union in 1991. In those cases, the function does a group-by arrange for
the more fractionalized/polarized estimate under the (reasonable, I think)
assumption that these are estimates prior to the dissolution of those
states. If this is problematic, feel free to consult the underlying data
and merge those in manually.
</p>
<p>The underlying data have both Gleditsch-Ward codes and Correlates of War
codes. The merge it makes depends on what you declare as the "master"
system at the top of the pipe (i.e. in <code>create_dyadyears()</code> or
<code>create_stateyears()</code>). If, for example, you run
<code>create_stateyears(system="cow")</code> and follow it with
<code>add_gwcode_to_cow()</code>, the merge will be on the Correlates of War
codes and not the Gleditsch-Ward codes. You can see the script mechanics
to see how this is achieved.
</p>
<p>Be mindful that the data are fundamentally state-year and that extensions
to leader-level data should be understood as approximations for leaders
in a given state-year.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_creg_fractionalization()</code> takes a dyad-year, leader-year,
leader-dyad-year, or state-data frame, whether the primary state
identifiers are from the Correlates of War system or the Gleditsch-Ward
system, and  returns information about the fractionalization and
polarization of the state(s) in a given year. The function returns four
additional columns when the data are state-year and returns eight
additional columns when the data are state-year (or leader-year).
The columns returned are the fractionalization of ethnic groups, the
polarization of ethnic groups, the fractionalization of religious groups,
and the polarization of religious groups. When the data are dyad-year
(or leader-dyad-year), the return doubles because it provides information
for both states in the dyad.
