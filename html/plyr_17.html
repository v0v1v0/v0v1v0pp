<h2>Count the number of occurences.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Equivalent to <code>as.data.frame(table(x))</code>, but does not include
combinations with zero counts.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">count(df, vars = NULL, wt_var = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>data frame to be processed</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vars</code></td>
<td>
<p>variables to count unique values of</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>wt_var</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional variable to weight by - if this is non-NULL, count
will sum up the value of this variable for each combination of id
variables.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Speed-wise count is competitive with <code>table</code> for single
variables, but it really comes into its own when summarising multiple
dimensions because it only counts combinations that actually occur in the
data.
</p>
<p>Compared to <code>table</code> + <code>as.data.frame</code>, <code>count</code>
also preserves the type of the identifier variables, instead of converting
them to characters/factors.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a data frame with label and freq columns
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Count of each value of "id" in the first 100 cases
count(baseball[1:100,], vars = "id")
# Count of ids, weighted by their "g" loading
count(baseball[1:100,], vars = "id", wt_var = "g")
count(baseball, "id", "ab")
count(baseball, "lg")
# How many stints do players do?
count(baseball, "stint")
# Count of times each player appeared in each of the years they played
count(baseball[1:100,], c("id", "year"))
# Count of counts
count(count(baseball[1:100,], c("id", "year")), "id", "freq")
count(count(baseball, c("id", "year")), "freq")
</code></pre>
