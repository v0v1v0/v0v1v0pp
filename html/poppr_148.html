<h2>Simulated data illustrating a Minimum Spanning Network based on Bruvo's
Distance</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data were simulated using SimuPOP version 1.0.8 with 
99.9% clonal reproduction over 10,000 generations. Populations were
assigned post-hoc and are simply present for the purposes of demonstrating
a minimum spanning network with Bruvo's distance.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(partial_clone)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>a [genind()] object with 50 individuals, 10 loci, and four 
populations.
