<h2>Partially Balanced t-Designs (PBtDesigns)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package contains functions named PBtD() for generating partially balanced t-designs along with their parameters, information matrices, average variance factors and canonical efficiency factors.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">PBtD(v, Series)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>v</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of treatments</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Series</code></td>
<td>
<p>Series of Partially Balanced t-Designs</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Three series are given for generating of partially balanced t-designs namely Series 1, Series 2 and Series 3.
</p>
<p>Series 1 are designs having equal block sizes and with treatment structure 4(t + 1).
</p>
<p>Series 2 are designs having equal block sizes and with treatment as a prime number.
</p>
<p>Series 3 consists of designs with unequal block sizes and with treatment structure n(n-1)/2.
</p>
<p>This function generates partially balanced t-designs along with their parameters, information matrices, average variance factors and canonical efficiency factors.
