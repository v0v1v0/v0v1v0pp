<h2>Spectra for a multichannel LED bulb</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A collection of lamp emission spectra for a household LED bulb
with four channels and a remote control allowing color mixing. In addition
character vectors useful as indexes for extracting subsets of the data are
defined. Pairs of RGB channels are used in mixes. This is by design of the
lamp and/or its remote control. The lamp here used is a 7.6 W, 230 V, E-27
LED lamp bulb accompanied by a small wireless remote control from a Swedish
supplier. Similar (identical?) lamps are at the moment (early 2018) widely
available through eBay and Aliexpress sellers.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ledsavers.mspct

ledsavers_channels

ledsavers_mixes

ledsavers_RG_mixes

ledsavers_RB_mixes

ledsavers_GB_mixes
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>ledsavers.mspct</code> is a <code>"source_mspct"</code> object containing 
a collection of 16 <code>"source_spct"</code> objects as members. Members are
named.
</p>
<p><code>ledsavers_channels</code>, <code>ledsavers_mixes</code>, <code>ledsavers_RG_mixes</code>,
<code>ledsavers_RB_mixes</code>, <code>ledsavers_GB_mixes</code> are character vectors
containing subsets of <code>names(ledsavers.mspct)</code>.
</p>
<p>An object of class <code>character</code> of length 4.
</p>
<p>An object of class <code>character</code> of length 12.
</p>
<p>An object of class <code>character</code> of length 4.
</p>
<p>An object of class <code>character</code> of length 4.
</p>
<p>An object of class <code>character</code> of length 4.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>ledsavers.mspct</code>  contains a collection of 16 <code>"source_spct"</code>
objects with spectral emission data for each of the colors obtainable from
the lamp. All colors were measured at maximum power output although the lamp
supports dimming. The lamp was maintained at the same distance from the 
input optics so the different spectra are comparable and provided expressed
in calibrated units.
</p>
<p>The variables in each member spectrum are as follows: </p>
 <ul>
<li>
<p>w.length (nm) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> s.e.irrad (relative energy based units) </p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We thank Prof. Lars Olof Bjoern for the gift of the lamp.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Instrument used: Ocean Optics Maya2000 Pro single-monochromator array
spectroradiometer with a Bentham cosine corrected input optics. A complex
set of corrections and calibration procedure used. Raw spectral data
processed with R package MayaCalc. The <code>source_spct</code> objects have 
attributes with additional information on the measurement and data processing.
Measurements done by Pedro J. Aphalo. Data acquired using R package 'ooacquire'.
