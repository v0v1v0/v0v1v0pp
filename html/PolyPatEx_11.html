<h2>Count potential fathers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Count the number of potential fathers detected for each progeny.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">potentialFatherCounts(dataset, mismatches = 0, VLTMin = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dataset</code></td>
<td>
<p>list: a list structure previously output from
<code>genotPPE</code> or <code>phenotPPE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mismatches</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer: the maximum allowed number of
mismatching loci between candidate and progeny, before the
candidate is rejected as a potential father.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>VLTMin</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer: the  minimum number of ‘valid’ loci
(loci at which a valid progeny-candidate comparison was possible)
required for a candidate to be considered as a potential father.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Given the output from <code>genotPPE</code> or
<code>phenotPPE</code>,  <code>potentialFatherCounts</code> returns,
for each progeny, the number of candidates that are identified as
potential fathers.
</p>
<p>To decide whether a given candidate is a potential father to a
given progeny, <code>potentialFatherCounts</code> uses the quantities
FLCount (the number of loci at which a candidate can provide a
gamete compatible with the progeny) and VLTotal (the number of
loci at which a valid comparison was possible - ‘valid’
loci) that are returned by <code>genotPPE</code> or
<code>phenotPPE</code>.
</p>
<p>For a candidate to be identified as a potential father of a
progeny, there are two criteria to be met:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code>VLTotal &gt;= max(VLTMin,mismatches+1)</code>,
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>FLCount &gt;= VLTotal-mismatches</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here, <code>VLTmin</code> and <code>mismatches</code> are user-specified
parameters. <code>VLTmin</code> allows the user to ensure that a
candidate is only considered for potential fatherhood if a
sufficient number of valid loci were available for comparison.
<code>mismatches</code> allows the user to specify a maximum number of
allowed mismatching loci between progeny and candidate, before
the candidate is rejected as a potential father.  Hence the user
may wish to relax the condition that ALL valid loci must match for
a candidate to be regarded as a potential father to a progeny.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame, containing columns <code>Progeny</code> (progeny
id), <code>Mother</code> (id of the progeny's mother) and
<code>potentialFatherCount</code> (the number of potential fathers found
for the given progeny, given the criteria described above).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Using the example dataset 'FR_Genotype':
data(FR_Genotype)

## Since we did not load this dataset using inputData(), we must
## first process it with preprocessData() before doing anything
## else:
gData &lt;- preprocessData(FR_Genotype,
                        numLoci=7,
                        ploidy=4,

head(gData)  ## Checked and Cleaned version of FR_Genotype

gPPE &lt;- genotPPE(gData)  ## Perform the exclusion analyses

## Obtain counts of potential fathers of each seedling, allowing a
## single allele mismatch:
pFC &lt;- potentialFatherCounts(gPPE,mismatches=1,VLTMin=2)

## pFC can be viewed or written to file via, e.g. write.csv()
