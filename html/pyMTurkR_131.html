<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A simple function to grant a bonus to one or more workers. The function is
somewhat picky in that it requires a WorkerId, the AssignmentId for an
assignment that worker has completed, an amount, and a reason for the bonus,
for each bonus to be paid. Optionally, the amount and reason can be
specified as single (character string) values, which will be used for each
bonus.
</p>
<p><code>bonus()</code>, <code>paybonus()</code>, and <code>sendbonus()</code> are aliases.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame containing the WorkerId, AssignmentId, amount, reason,
and whether each request to bonus was valid.
