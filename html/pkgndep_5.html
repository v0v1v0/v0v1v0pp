<p>Co-heaviness for pairs of parent packages
</p>

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<td>
<p>Whether to return the absolute measure or the relative measure.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>a</code></td>

<p>A constant added for calculating the relative measure.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Denote a package as P and its two strong parent packages as A and B, i.e., parent packages in "Depends", "Imports" and "LinkingTo", 
the co-heaviness for A and B is calculated as follows.
</p>
<p>Denote S_A as the set of reduced dependency packages when only moving A to "Suggests" of P, and denote S_B as the set of reduced dependency
packages when only moving B to "Suggests" of P, denote S_AB as the set of reduced dependency packages when moving A and B together to "Suggests" of P,
the co-heaviness of A, B on P is calculatd as <code>length(setdiff(S_AB, union(S_A, S_B)))</code>, which is the number of reduced package only caused by co-action of A and B.
</p>
<p>Note the co-heaviness is only calculated for parent packages in "Depends", "Imports" and "LinkingTo".
</p>
<p>When <code>jaccard</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>, the function returns jaccard coeffcient. <code>setdiff(S_AB, union(S_A, S_B))</code> is actually
the set of dependencies imported by and only by two parent packages A and B. Thus the jaccard coeffcient is calculated as
<code>length(setdiff(S_AB, union(S_A, S_B)))/length(S_AB)</code>.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# DESeq version 1.36.0, the dependencies have been changed in later versions.
x = readRDS(system.file("extdata", "DESeq2_dep.rds", package = "pkgndep"))
hm = co_heaviness(x)
ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(hm)
co_heaviness(x, jaccard = TRUE)

## End(Not run)
