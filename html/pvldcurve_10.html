<h2>Experimentally determined leaf drying data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing repeatedly measured fresh weights of transpiring leaves subjected to
different soil moisture conditions during their growth (n = 6) and their saturated fresh weight and dry weight.
togeher with their saturated fresh weight, their fresh weight before saturation, their dry weight and leaf area.
