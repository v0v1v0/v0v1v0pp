Extract a training dataset for OCR procedure
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows to extract a training dataset for OCR procedure performed by <code>getExposure</code>. It is currently optimized for stardot cameras.   
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">trainOCR(image.path, nsamples=100)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>image.path</code></td>
<td>

<p>The absolute path to a folder of JPEG binary images, as converted from RGB with the function <code>binaryConvert()</code>  
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nsamples</code></td>
<td>

<p>The maximum number of sampled images to be used. No need to change it.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function allows to prepare a training dataset that will be used in function <code>getExposure()</code>. You need to identify 0-9 numbers and the capital letter E (Exposure), which are then used in <code>getExposure()</code>. 
The procedure makes use of locator to subsequently crop your image, so make sure you know how this function works in your OS. When you run the function a first image pops up on your graphic device. You have to click with the mouse on topleft and bottom right of the rectangle you want to crop. I suggest to crop to the entire string of text with all picture information, so to have the largest sample of numbers in it. When you close locator (right-click in Linux-OS, but likely also GUI-dependent), the cropped image will show up providing a zoom to the selection. The title in the plot helps you to remember which numbers you still have to define. Choose a number (the order you choose numbers does not matter) and make a second crop around it (always topleft, bottomright). Close locator. A third zoom will show up, gridded pixel by pixel. Again, crop your number topleft bottomright with a rectangle that exactly includes all pixels of your number. Close locator. In R command line you will be asked to type the number you have just drawn, or letter E. Type the number and press Enter. You will be prompted to a new image where you follow the procedure again to identify other numbers. When you will ne done with all numbers and E letter, you will get a named list with 11 elements. Each element will be a binary matrix for each of your numbers, and letter E.
