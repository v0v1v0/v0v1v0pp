<h2>Extract Latent Factor Matrices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Extract the latent factor matrices for users (rows) and
columns (items) from a Poisson factorization model object, as returned
by function 'poismf'.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get.factor.matrices(model, add_names = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>A Poisson factorization model, as produced by 'poismf'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>add_names</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to add row names to the matrices if the indices
were internally remapped - they will only be so if the 'X' passed to 'poismf'
was a 'data.frame'. Note that if passing 'X' as 'data.frame' with integer indices
to 'poismf', once row names are added, subsetting such matrix by an integer will
give the row at that position - that is, if you want to obtain the corresponding
row for ID=2 from 'X' in 'factors$A', you need to use 'factors$A["2", ]', not
'factors$A[2, ]'.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If 'X' passed to 'poismf' was a 'data.frame', the mapping between
IDs from 'X' to row numbers in 'A' and column numbers in 'B' are avaiable under
'model$levels_A' and 'model$levels_B', respectively. They can also be obtained
through 'get.model.mappings', and will be added as row names if
using 'add_names=TRUE'. <b>Be careful about subsetting with integers</b> (see
documentation for 'add_names' for details).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>List with entries 'A' (the user factors) and 'B' (the item factors).
