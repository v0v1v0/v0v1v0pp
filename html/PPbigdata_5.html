<h2>
1-dim/2-dim Guided Tour for Big Data based on Data Nuggets
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function performs a 1-dim/2-dim guided tour path for big data based on constructed data nuggets with their weights and scales. The guided tour tries to find a projection  with a higher value of PP index than the current projection.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">guidedTourNugg(nugg, weight, scale, dim, index = c("NH","Hole","CM"), qt = 0.8,...)
</code></pre>

</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weight</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of the weight parameter for each data nugget. Its length should be the same as the number of data nuggets, i.e., nrow(nugg). Must be of class numeric or integer.
</p>

<td><code>scale</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of the scale parameter for each data nugget. Its length should be the same as the number of data nuggets, i.e., nrow(nuggproj) for 2-dim projection/length(nuggproj) for 1-dim projection. Must be of class numeric or integer.

<p>A character indicating the PP index function to be used to guide the tour:
"NH" - Natural Hermite Index for data nuggets
"Hole" - Hole Index for data nuggets
"CM" - Central Mass Index for data nuggets</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<td>
<p>For projected plots of 2-dim tour, a scalar with value in <code>[0,1]</code> indicating the probability used to obtain a sample quantile of the data nugget weights as the maximal value to transform weights to colors for the plot. Defaults to be 0.8. See <code>plotNugg</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function performs a 1-dim/2-dim guided tour path for big data based on constructed data nuggets with their weights and scales. The guided tour tries to find a projection  with a higher value of PP index than the current projection.
</p>
<p>Data nuggets are a representative sample meant to summarize Big Data by reducing a large dataset to a much smaller dataset by eliminating redundant points while also preserving the peripheries of the dataset. Each data nugget is defined by a center (location), weight (importance), and scale (internal variability). Data nuggets for a large dataset could be created and refined by functions <code>create.DN</code> or <code>refine.DN</code> in the package <code>datanugget</code>.
</p>
<p>Based on the data nuggets from big data, a projection pursuit guided tour is performed to explore the multivariate data. Unlike walking randomly to discover projections in grand tour, the guided tour selects the next target basis by optimizing a projection pursuit index function defining interesting projections. Here the considered choices of PP indices include Nature Hermite index, Hole index and CM index for big data based on data nuggets. See details in <code>NHnugg</code>, <code>HoleNugg</code>, and <code>CMNugg</code>.
</p>
<p>This function for data nuggets is based on functions about guided tour in the package <code>tourr</code>. See details in <code>guided_tour</code>, <code>animate</code>, <code>animate_xy</code>, <code>display_dist</code>, and <code>display_xy</code>. For 2-dim guided tour, the projected data nugget centers are plotted with colors based on their weights where lighter green represents larger weights. For 1-dim guided tour, a weighted density histgram of 1-dim projected data nugget centers is plotted considering the data nugget weights. See details in <code>wtd.hist</code>. The loadings of each variable for projections are also shown at each step.
