<h3>Irregular plurals</h3>

<p>Many words in English have both regular and irregular plural forms.
For example, the word "person" can be pluralized as "persons" or "people",
and the word "formula" can be pluralized as "formulas" or "formulae".
<code>plu</code> offers several options for how to handle words with multiple plurals.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The <code>moderate</code> list attempts to apply the most common pluralization,
whether it is regular or irregular.
This chooses the irregular plural "people" but the regular plural "formulas".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The <code>conservative</code> list attempts to apply an irregular plural to every word
that has one.
This chooses "people" and "formulae", but still uses regular plurals for
words that have no irregular plural form.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The <code>liberal</code> list attempts to apply a regular plural to every word that
has one.
This chooses "persons" and "formulas", but still uses irregular plurals for
words that have no common regular plural, like "women".
Many words in English have invariant plurals that look exactly the same as
their singular forms, like "fish" or "deer".
The <code>liberal</code> list attempts to use regular plurals for these words,
producing "fishes" and "deers".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The <code>none</code> list applies regular pluralization rules to all words, even
those with no common regular plural.
This produces, for example, "womans" as a plural for "woman" even though this
is not a common English word.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
