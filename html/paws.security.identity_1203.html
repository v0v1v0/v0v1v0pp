<h2>Adds or updates one or more tags that are associated with an Amazon
Security Lake resource: a subscriber, or the data lake configuration for
your Amazon Web Services account in a particular Amazon Web Services
Region</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Adds or updates one or more tags that are associated with an Amazon Security Lake resource: a subscriber, or the data lake configuration for your Amazon Web Services account in a particular Amazon Web Services Region. A <em>tag</em> is a label that you can define and associate with Amazon Web Services resources. Each tag consists of a required <em>tag key</em> and an associated <em>tag value</em>. A <em>tag key</em> is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A <em>tag value</em> acts as a descriptor for a tag key. Tags can help you identify, categorize, and manage resources in different ways, such as by owner, environment, or other criteria. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/tagging-resources.html">Tagging Amazon Security Lake resources</a> in the <em>Amazon Security Lake User Guide</em>.
