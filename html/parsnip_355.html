<h2>Save information about models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function writes a tab delimited file to the package to capture
information about the known models. This information includes packages in
the tidymodels GitHub repository as well as packages that are known to work
well with tidymodels packages (e.g. not only <span class="pkg">parsnip</span> but also
<span class="pkg">tune</span>, etc.). There may be more model definitions in other extension
packages that are not included here.
</p>
<p>These data are used to document engines for each model function man page.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">update_model_info_file(path = "inst/models.tsv")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string for the location of the tab delimited file.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>See our
<a href="https://tidymodels.github.io/model-implementation-principles/">model implementation guidelines</a>
on best practices for modeling and modeling packages.
</p>
<p>It is highly recommended that the known parsnip extension packages are loaded.
The unexported <span class="pkg">parsnip</span> function <code>extensions()</code> will list these.
