<h2>Compute personal values from TIVI data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function computes personal values scores and different higher-order
dimensions related to Schwartz's theoretical framework based on the 10 items
of the ultra-brief TIVI Questionnaire (Sandy et al., 2017).
By default, the function applies the recommended statistical adjustment
(MRAT centering) as suggested by the authors, to correct for
individual differences in response styles thus enhancing the interpretative
validity of the scores.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">tivi(
  df,
  items = NULL,
  compute = "all",
  correction = TRUE,
  na.rm = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing the raw responses for the 10 TIVI items.
If "items" is not provided, it must have exactly 10 columns, and their order
must correspond to the TIVI items.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>items</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional vector containing the names or indices of the columns
that correspond to the TIVI items. Must be exactly 10 items. If NULL,
the function assumes the items are the only columns given in the "df" parameter.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>compute</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character. Indicates which personal values scores to compute and return.
Possible values are "all" (default; computes all first and second-order personal values scores),
"ten.values" (computes the ten basic personal values scores),
"four.higher" (computes the four main higher-order values scores),
"two.foci" (computes two higher-order values scores: self-focused values that regulate personal interests and characteristics, and
other-focused values that regulate social relationships),
"two.anxiety" (computes two higher-order values based on their relation to anxiety:
self-protective values aimed at coping with anxiety due to uncertainty in the social and physical world, and
growth-oriented or self-expansive values that express anxiety-free motivations).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>correction</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. When TRUE, the scores are corrected for individual differences
in the use of the response scale. Default is TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>na.rm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. When TRUE, NAs are ignored in calculations; when FALSE,
NAs are preserved and will affect calculations. Default is TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with computed values. If both "df" and "items" parameters are
provided, the returned data frame includes the original data with the calculations
appended as new columns.
