<h2>LEDs with reflectors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A collection of emission spectra of a light-emitting-diode
when combined with different reflectors.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">COB_reflectors.mspct
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>"source_mspct"</code> object containing 4
<code>"source_spct"</code> objects.
</p>
<p>In each of the member spectra, the variables are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> w.length (nm)  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> s.e.irrad (W m-2 nm-1)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>"COB_reflectors.mspct"</code> object contains
<code>"source_spct"</code> objects with spectral irradiance data with the same
Optisolis COB LED from Nichia, and different reflectors from the Mirella-G2
series from LEDiL . Distance from LED to cosine diffuser was 159 mm.
Spectra are not normalized. It needs to be taken into account than even in
these cases measurements have not been done in an optical bench, so values
of spectral irradiance are subject to errors due to possible
misalignment.
</p>
<p>The COB LED used is the chip-on-board (COB) Optisolis type
NFCWL036B-V3-Rfcb0 from Nichia with CRI &gt; 95. Nominal electrical power of
10.3 W at nominal current of 270 mA. Spectra are for the COB over-driven at
350 mA, which is possible with enough cooling, but not recommended.
</p>
<p>The spectral data are not expressed at constant wavelength intervals. Not
only the intervals vary in the raw data from the array spectrometer, but in
addition function <code>thin_wl</code> has been applied to
reduce the storage space needed. In brief the wavelength interval has been
increased as much as possible in those regions of the spectrum that lack
detailed features (such as linear slopes and wavelength regions with zero
light emission).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Please see the metadata in each spectrum. These metadata are
stored as attributes of the individual <code>source_spct</code> objects and can accessed with functions 
<code>comment</code>,
<code>getWhatMeasured</code>,
<code>getWhenMeasured</code>, 
<code>getHowMeasured</code>, 
<code>getInstrDesc</code> and
<code>getInstrSettings</code>.
See also the <code>comment</code> attribute of the <code>COB_reflectors.mspct</code> 
object.
