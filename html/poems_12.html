<h2>poems: Pattern-oriented ensemble modeling and simulation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <em>poems</em> package provides a framework of interoperable
<code>R6</code> classes for building ensembles of viable models via the
pattern-oriented modeling (POM) approach (Grimm et al., 2005). The package includes
classes for encapsulating and generating model parameters, and managing the POM
workflow. The workflow includes: model setup; generating model parameters via
Latin hypercube sampling; running multiple sampled model simulations; collating
summary results; and validating and selecting an ensemble of models that best match
known patterns. By default, model validation and selection utilizes an approximate
Bayesian computation (ABC) approach (Beaumont, Zhang, &amp; Balding, 2002), although
alternative user-defined functionality could be employed. The package also includes
a spatially explicit demographic population model simulation engine, which includes
default functionality for density dependence, correlated environmental stochasticity,
stage-based transitions, and distance-based dispersal. The user may customize the
simulator by defining functionality for translocations, harvesting, mortality,
and other processes, as well as defining the sequence order for the simulator
processes. The framework could also be adapted for use with other model simulators
by utilizing its extendable (inheritable) base classes.
</p>


<h3>Framework and workflow</h3>

<p>The <em>poems</em> framework utilizes a hierarchy  of extendable (inheritable)
<code>R6</code> class objects that work together to manage a POM
workflow for building an ensemble of simulation models.

<img src="../help/figures/framework.png" alt="framework.png"></p>
<p> The workflow is summarized in the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p> Create a simulation model template (a <code>SimulationModel</code> or
inherited class object) with appropriate fixed parameters for the study domain.
Also define a study region via the <code>Region</code> class if the
simulations are to be spatially explicit.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Create generators (<code>Generator</code> or inherited class objects) for
dynamically generating (non-singular) model parameters represented by data
structures, such as arrays or lists.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Generate a data frame of sampled variable model parameters using the
<code>LatinHypercubeSampler</code>. This will include singular model parameter
values as well as input parameters for the generators.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Create a <code>SimulationManager</code> object configured with the
simulation model (template), the generators, and the sample parameter data
frame. Running this manager sets and runs the models via the simulator function
for each set (row) of sampled parameters, utilising the generators when
required. The results of each model simulation run are written to a file. A
simulation log file is also created.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Create a <code>ResultsManager</code> object configured with the sample
parameter data and result file details. Running this manager constructs a data
frame of configured summary metrics, one row for each simulation result file.
The manager utilizes the <code>SimulationResults</code> (or inherited) class
to encapsulate, and dynamically generate additional derived, results. The
metrics are generated via user-defined specifications and functions for
calculating each metric from the results (objects).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Create a <code>Validator</code> object configured with the sample
parameter data, summary metrics, and target (observed) pattern values for each
metric. By default, the validator utilizes an approximate Bayesian computation
(ABC) validation method via the <code>abc</code> library, although
the validator (call) function can be configured to utilize other library or
user-defined functions. Running the validator (with appropriate call function
configuration) produces an ensemble of models (indices to sampled parameters)
that were found to best match the targets. Diagnostic outputs may also be
produced (depending on the call function and its configuration).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The selected models may then be utilized for further studies, such as
alternative model scenarios or counterfactuals. This can be achieved by
utilizing the selected subset of parameter samples to form inputs for further
model simulations (by repeating the steps above).
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Population modeling components</h3>

<p> The spatially explicit demographic population model
simulation engine and its associated classes are summarized by the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <p><code>population_simulator</code> function: The simulation engine's main
function processes the model input parameters, controls the flow, calling other
function modules as required, and returns the results of each simulation.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>population_density</code> function: Module for configuring
and performing density dependence calculations at each simulation time step.
A user-defined function may be utilized.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>population_env_stoch</code> function: Module for configuring and
stochastically applying environmental variability to stage-based population
transition rates at each simulation time step.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>population_transitions</code> function: Module for configuring and
performing stage-based demographic transitions of population abundances at each
simulation time step.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>population_transformation</code> function: Module for configuring and
performing user-defined transformations to staged population abundances. This
functionality is utilized when defining functions for <code>translocation</code>,
<code>harvest</code>, <code>mortality</code>, or other custom transformative functions.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>population_dispersal</code> function: Module for configuring and
performing dispersal calculations at each simulation time step. A user-defined
function may be utilized.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>population_results</code> function: Module for configuring,
initializing, and collating simulation results.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>PopulationModel</code> class: Inherited from
<code>SimulationModel</code>, this class encapsulates the input parameters
utilized by the <code>population_simulator</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>SimulatorReference</code> class: This simple
<code>R6</code> class enables user-defined functionality to maintain
persistent (attached) attributes and to write to the simulator results.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>SpatialCorrelation</code> class: Provides functionality for
generating parameters that can be utilized when optionally applying a spatial
correlation within the simulator's environmental variability calculations.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>DispersalGenerator</code> class: Inherited from
<code>Generator</code>, this class provides functionality for generating
distance-based dispersal parameters that can be utilized when performing
dispersal calculations.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>DispersalFriction</code> class: Provides functionality for
adjusting the (equivalent) distance between population cells given a
spatio-temporal frictional landscape. These adjustments may be utilized by the
<code>DispersalGenerator</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>PopulationResults</code> class: Inherited from
<code>SimulationResults</code>, this class encapsulates the results generated
by the <code>population_simulator</code>, as well as dynamically generating
additional derived results.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
