<h2>Spectral irradiance of UVB lamps at different temperatures.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Dataset of spectral irradiance from a set of two Q-Panel UVB-313 40W
fluorescent tubes, measured at different temperatures.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">qp_uvb313_temp.spct

qp_uvb313_temp.mspct
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>qp_uvb313_temp.spct</code> is a <code>"source_spct"</code> object with 777 rows (290 nm to 400 nm, 1.0 nm step) and 3
variables.
</p>
<p>The variables are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> temperature (C)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> w.length (nm)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> s.e.irrad (W m-2 nm-1)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>qp_uvb313_temp.mspct</code> is a <code>"source_mspct"</code> object containing a 
collection of
<code>"source_spct"</code> objects, each with 111 rows (290 nm to 400 nm,
1.0 nm step) and 2 variables.
</p>
<p>The variables in the member spectra are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> w.length (nm)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> s.e.irrad (W m-2 nm-1)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An object of class <code>source_mspct</code> (inherits from <code>generic_mspct</code>, <code>list</code>) with 7 rows and 1 columns.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Absolute values are comparable among the different temperatures. The lamps
and the cosine diffuser were located inside a Conviron growth chamber. The
measurements were done with a recently calibrated Macam double-monochromator
spectroradiometer located outside the chamber and maintained at constant room
temperature of 22 C. After each change in the temperature controller
set-point enough time was allowed after the temperature had stabilized inside
the chamber, for the output of the lamps to also become stable.
</p>
<p><code>qp_uvb313_temp.spct</code> contains data for different
temperatures in a "tidy" long form with a factor indicating the temperature
at which the lamp was during measurement. 
</p>
<p><code>qp_uvb313_temp.mspct</code> 
contains the same data as a collection of spectra stored in a
<code>"source_mspct"</code> object, with member <code>"source_spct"</code> objects
named minus5C, plus00C, plus05C, plus10C, plus20C, plus30C, and plus35C.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Instrument used: Macam SR-9010-PC scanning double monochromator
spectroradiometer with a cosine corrected input optics. Recently calibrated.
The lamps were driven by a high frequency electronic ballast.
