<h2>Situational determinants of anger-related behavior</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The raw data consist of the binary judgments of 115 first-year psychology students who indicated whether or not they would display 
each of 14 anger-related behaviors when being angry at someone in each of 9 situations. 
The 14 behaviors consist of 7 pairs of reactions that reflect a particular strategy to deal with situations in which 
one is angry at someone:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Anger-out: (a) You flew off the handle, (b) You started a fight
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Avoidance: (a) You avoided a confrontation, (b) You went out of the other's way
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Social sharing (a) You unburdened your heart to others, (b) You told others what had happened 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Assertive behavior: (a) You said what was bothering you in a direct and sober way, (b) You calmly explained what was bothering you 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Indirect behavior (a) You showed something was bothering you without saying anything, (b) You started to sulk 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Anger-in: (a) You suppressed your anger, (b) You bottled up your anger 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Reconciliation (a) You reconciled, (b) You talked things out</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The six situations are constructed by crossing the levels of two factors  with three levels: 
(1) the extent to which one likes the  instigator of anger (like, unfamilar, dislike), 
and (2) the status of the instigator of anger (lower status, equal status, higher status)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(anger2)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The data consist of a list of 5 objects:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> data: A 115 X 9 X 14 matrix of binary observations (0/1). The observation in cell <em>(i,j,k)</em> equals 1 if person <em>i</em> would display behavior
<em>k</em> in situation <em>j</em> and 0 otherwise.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> freq1: A 9 X 14 matrix of frequencies. The frequency in cell <em>(j,k)</em> indicates the number of respondents 
who indicate that they would display behavior <em>k</em> in situation <em>j</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> freqtot: A 9 X 14 matrix of frequencies. The frequency in cell <em>(j,k)</em> indicates the total number of respondents 
who judged the situation-response pair <em>(j,k)</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> rowlabels: A vector of labels for the situations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> columnlabels: A vector of labels for the anger-related behaviors.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
