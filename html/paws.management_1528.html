<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>RejectedPatchesAction</code></td>
<td>
<p>The action for Patch Manager to take on patches included in the
<code>RejectedPackages</code> list.
</p>
<p><strong>ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Linux and macOS</strong>: A package in the rejected patches list is installed
only if it is a dependency of another package. It is considered
compliant with the patch baseline, and its status is reported as
<code>INSTALLED_OTHER</code>. This is the default action if no option is specified.
</p>
<p><strong>Windows Server</strong>: Windows Server doesn't support the concept of
package dependencies. If a package in the rejected patches list and
already installed on the node, its status is reported as
<code>INSTALLED_OTHER</code>. Any package not already installed on the node is
skipped. This is the default action if no option is specified.
</p>
<p><strong>BLOCK</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>All OSs</strong>: Packages in the rejected patches list, and packages that
include them as dependencies, aren't installed by Patch Manager under
any circumstances. If a package was installed before it was added to the
rejected patches list, or is installed outside of Patch Manager
afterward, it's considered noncompliant with the patch baseline and its
status is reported as <code>INSTALLED_REJECTED</code>.</p>
