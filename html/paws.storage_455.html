<h2>This operation aborts a multipart upload</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This operation aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage consumed by all parts.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/s3_abort_multipart_upload/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/s3_abort_multipart_upload/</a> for full documentation.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">s3_abort_multipart_upload(
  Bucket,
  Key,
  UploadId,
  RequestPayer = NULL,
  ExpectedBucketOwner = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Bucket</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The bucket name to which the upload was taking place.
</p>
<p><strong>Directory buckets</strong> - When you use this operation with a directory
bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
<code> Bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com</code>. Path-style requests
are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen
Availability Zone. Bucket names must follow the format
<code> bucket_base_name--az-id--x-s3</code> (for example,
<code> DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3</code>). For information about bucket
naming restrictions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html">Directory bucket naming rules</a>
in the <em>Amazon S3 User Guide</em>.
</p>
<p><strong>Access points</strong> - When you use this action with an access point, you
must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name
or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you
must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point
hostname takes the form
<em>AccessPointName</em>-<em>AccountId</em>.s3-accesspoint.<em>Region</em>.amazonaws.com.
When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
name. For more information about access point ARNs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html">Using access points</a>
in the <em>Amazon S3 User Guide</em>.
</p>
<p>Access points and Object Lambda access points are not supported by
directory buckets.
</p>
<p><strong>S3 on Outposts</strong> - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on
Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The
S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form
<code> AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com</code>.
When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the
bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html">What is S3 on Outposts?</a>
in the <em>Amazon S3 User Guide</em>.</p>
