</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>RegionLinkingMode</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] Indicates whether to aggregate findings from all of the available
Regions in the current partition. Also determines whether to
automatically aggregate findings from new Regions as Security Hub
supports them and you opt into them.
</p>
<p>The selected option also determines how to use the Regions provided in
the Regions list.
</p>
<p>The options are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>ALL_REGIONS</code> - Aggregates findings from all of the Regions where
Security Hub is enabled. When you choose this option, Security Hub
also automatically aggregates findings from new Regions as Security
Hub supports them and you opt into them.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ALL_REGIONS_EXCEPT_SPECIFIED</code> - Aggregates findings from all of the
Regions where Security Hub is enabled, except for the Regions listed
in the <code>Regions</code> parameter. When you choose this option, Security
Hub also automatically aggregates findings from new Regions as
Security Hub supports them and you opt into them.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>SPECIFIED_REGIONS</code> - Aggregates findings only from the Regions
listed in the <code>Regions</code> parameter. Security Hub does not
automatically aggregate findings from new Regions.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>NO_REGIONS</code> - Aggregates no data because no Regions are selected as
linked Regions.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If <code>RegionLinkingMode</code> is <code>ALL_REGIONS_EXCEPT_SPECIFIED</code>, then this is a
space-separated list of Regions that do not aggregate findings to the
aggregation Region.

<p>If <code>RegionLinkingMode</code> is <code>SPECIFIED_REGIONS</code>, then this is a
space-separated list of Regions that do aggregate findings to the
aggregation Region.
</p>
<p>An <code>InvalidInputException</code> error results if you populate this field
while <code>RegionLinkingMode</code> is <code>NO_REGIONS</code>.</p>
