<h2>Constant-current dimming of LEDs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A collection of emission spectra of a light-emitting-diode
driven at different constant current.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">COB_dimming.mspct

COB_dimming.tb
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>"source_mspct"</code> object containing 8
<code>"source_spct"</code> objects.
</p>
<p>In each of the member spectra, the variables are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> w.length (nm)  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> s.e.irrad (W m-2 nm-1)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An object of class <code>tbl_df</code> (inherits from <code>tbl</code>, <code>data.frame</code>) with 8 rows and 6 columns.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>"COB_dimming.mspct"</code> object contains <code>"source_spct"</code>
objects with spectral irradiance data with the same Optisolis COB LED from
Nichia driven at different values of constant current. Distance from LED to
cosine diffuser was 159 mm; a reflector was attached to the LED to make the
light beam narrower. Spectra are not normalized. The position for
the LED with respect to the entrace optics did not vary among measurements.
</p>
<p>The COB LED used is the chip-on-board (COB) Optisolis type 
NFCWL036B-V3-Rfcb0 from Nichia with CRI &gt; 95. Nominal electrical power of
10.3 W at nominal current of 270 mA. So, two spectra are for the COB 
over-driven, which is possible with enough cooling, but not recommended.
</p>
<p>The spectral data are not expressed at constant wavelength intervals. Not
only the intervals vary in the raw data from the array spectrometer, but in
addition function <code>thin_wl</code> has been applied to
reduce the storage space needed. In brief the wavelength interval has been
increased as much as possible in those regions of the spectrum that lack
detailed features (such as linear slopes and wavelength regions with zero
light emission).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Please see the metadata in each spectrum. These metadata are
stored as attributes of the individual <code>source_spct</code> objects and can accessed with functions 
<code>comment</code>,
<code>getWhatMeasured</code>,
<code>getWhenMeasured</code>, 
<code>getHowMeasured</code>, 
<code>getInstrDesc</code> and
<code>getInstrSettings</code>.
See also the <code>comment</code> attribute of the <code>COB_dimming.mspct</code> 
object.
