<h2>Mutual information of feature triples</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates mutual information of each triple of features, that is
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">I(X_i;X_j;X_k).</code>
</p>



<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">triScores(X, threads = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>Attribute table, given as a data frame with either factors (preferred), booleans, integers (treated as categorical) or reals (which undergo automatic categorisation; see below for details).
Single vector will be interpreted as a data.frame with one column.
<code>NA</code>s are not allowed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threads</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of threads to use; default value, 0, means all available to OpenMP.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with four columns; first three (<code>Var1</code>, <code>Var2</code> and <code>Var3</code>) are names of features, fourth, <code>MI</code> is the value of the mutual information.
The order of features does not matter, hence only </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">n(n-1)(n-2)/6</code>
</p>
<p> unique, sorted triples are evaluated.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The method requires input to be discrete to use empirical estimators of distribution, and, consequently, information gain or entropy.
To allow smoother user experience, praznik automatically coerces non-factor vectors in inputs, which requires additional time, memory and may yield confusing results – the best practice is to convert data to factors prior to feeding them in this function.
Real attributes are cut into about 10 equally-spaced bins, following the heuristic often used in literature.
Precise number of cuts depends on the number of objects; namely, it is <code class="reqn">n/3</code>, but never less than 2 and never more than 10.
Integers (which technically are also numeric) are treated as categorical variables (for compatibility with similar software), so in a very different way – one should be aware that an actually numeric attribute which happens to be an integer could be coerced into a <code class="reqn">n</code>-level categorical, which would have a perfect mutual information score and would likely become a very disruptive false positive.
</p>
<p>In a current version, the maximal number of features accepted is 2345, which gives a bit less than 2^32 triples.
The equation used for calculation is
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">I(X_i;X_j;X_k)=I(X_i;X_k)+I(X_j;X_k)-I(X_i,X_j;X_k).</code>
</p>

<p>Henceforth, please mind that rounding errors may occur and influence reproducibility.
