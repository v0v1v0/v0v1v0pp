<h2>A first approximation to Random Effects Exploratory Factor Analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Inspired, in part, by the wprifm function in the profileR package, fa.random removes between subject differences in mean level and then does a normal exploratory factor analysis of the ipsatized data.  Functionally, this removes a general factor of the data before factoring. To prevent non-positive definiteness of the residual data matrix, a very small amount of random noise is added to each variable. This is just a call to fa after removing the between subjects effect. Read the help file for <code>fa</code> for a detailed explanation of all of the input parameters and the output objects. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fa.random(data, nfactors = 1, fix = TRUE, n.obs = NA, n.iter = 1, rotate = "oblimin",
 scores = "regression", residuals = FALSE, SMC = TRUE, covar = FALSE, missing = FALSE,  
 impute = "median", min.err = 0.001, max.iter = 50, symmetric = TRUE, warnings = TRUE,
  fm = "minres", alpha = 0.1, p = 0.05, oblique.scores = FALSE, np.obs = NULL, 
  use = "pairwise", cor = "cor", weight = NULL, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<td><code>fix</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, then a small amount of random error is added to each observed variable to keep the matrix positive semi-definite.  If FALSE, then this is not done but because the matrix is non-positive semi-definite it will need to be smoothed when finding the scores and the various statistics.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n.obs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of observations used to find the correlation matrix if using a correlation matrix.  Used for finding the goodness of fit statistics. Must be specified if using a correlaton matrix and finding confidence intervals. Ignored.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>np.obs</code></td>
<td>
<p>The pairwise number of observations. Used if using a correlation matrix and asking for a minchi solution.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rotate</code></td>
<td>
<p>"none", "varimax", "quartimax",  "bentlerT", "equamax", "varimin", "geominT" and "bifactor" are orthogonal rotations.  "Promax", "promax", "oblimin", "simplimax", "bentlerQ,  "geominQ" and "biquartimin" and "cluster" are possible oblique transformations of the solution.  The default is to do a oblimin transformation, although  versions prior to 2009 defaulted to varimax. SPSS seems to do a Kaiser normalization before doing Promax, this is done here by the call to "promax" which does the normalization before calling Promax in GPArotation.</p>

Alternatives for  estimating factor scores include simple regression ("Thurstone"), correlaton preserving ("tenBerge") as well as "Anderson" and "Bartlett" using the appropriate algorithms ( <code>factor.scores</code>). Although scores="tenBerge" is probably preferred for most solutions, it will lead to problems with some improper correlation matrices.  </p>

<td><code>SMC</code></td>

<p>Use squared multiple correlations (SMC=TRUE) or use 1  as initial communality estimate. Try using 1 if imaginary eigen values are reported. If SMC is a vector of length the number of variables, then these values are used as starting values in the case of fm='pa'. </p>

This will be slower.  fm="wls" will do a weighted least squares (WLS) solution, fm="gls" does a generalized weighted least squares (GLS), fm="pa" will do the principal factor solution, fm="ml" will do a maximum likelihood factor analysis. fm="minchi" will minimize the sample size weighted chi square when treating pairwise correlations with different number of subjects per pair. fm ="minrank" will do a minimum rank factor analysis. "old.min" will do minimal residual the way it was done prior to April, 2017 (see discussion below).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is inspired by the wprifm function in the profileR package and the citation there to a paper by Davison, Kim and Close (2009).  The basic logic is to extract a means vector from each subject and then to analyze the resulting ipsatized data matrix.  This can be seen as removing acquiecence in the case of personality items, or the general factor, in the case of ability items.  Factors composed of items that are all keyed the same way (e.g., Neuroticism in the <code>bfi</code> data set) will be most affected by this technique. 
</p>
<p>The output is identical to the normal <code>fa</code> output with the addition of two objects:  subject and within.r.  The subject object is just the vector of the mean score for each subject on all the items. within.r is just the correlation of each item with those scores.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>An interesting, but not necessarily good, idea. 
To see what this does if there is a general factor, consider the unrotated solutions to the ability data set. In particular, compare the first factor loading with its congruence to the ipsatized solution means vector correlated with the items (the within.r object).  </p>
