<h2>The Elo Rating System Employed By The FIDE</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements the Elo rating system for estimating the relative 
skill level of players in two-player games such as chess,
implementing a version similar to that employed by the FIDE. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fide(x, status = NULL, init = 2200, gamma = 0, kfac = kfide, 
    history = FALSE, sort = TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing four variables: (1) a numeric
vector denoting the time period in which the game took place
(2) a numeric or character identifier for player one (3)
a numeric or character identifier for player two and (4)
the result of the game expressed as a number, typically
equal to one for a player one win, zero for a player two
win and one half for a draw.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>status</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame with the current status of the
system. If not <code>NULL</code>, this needs to be a data frame 
in the form of the <code>ratings</code> component of the returned 
list, containing variables named <code>Player</code>, <code>Rating</code>,
and optionally <code>Games</code>, <code>Win</code>, <code>Draw</code>, 
<code>Loss</code> <code>Lag</code> and <code>Elite</code>, which are set 
to zero if not given, and <code>Opponent</code>, which is set
to the player rating if not given.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>init</code></td>
<td>
<p>The rating at which to initialize a new player not
appearing in <code>status</code>. Must be a single number. If
different initializations for different players are required,
this can be done using <code>status</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gamma</code></td>
<td>
<p>A player one advantage parameter; either a single
value or a numeric vector equal to the number of rows in 
<code>x</code>. Positive values favour player one, while negative 
values favour player two. This could represent the advantage 
of playing at home, or the advantage of playing white for chess. 
Note that this is not passed to <code>predict.rating</code>, 
which has its own <code>gamma</code> parameter.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>kfac</code></td>
<td>
<p>The K factor parameter. Can be a single number or
a vectorized function of three arguments, the first being the
ratings, the second being the number of games played, and the
third being a binary indicator for whether or not a player 
has ever achieved a rating above 2400.  See <code>kfide</code>, 
<code>kgames</code>  and <code>krating</code> for examples.
The function <code>kfide</code> is used by default.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>history</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code> returns the entire history for each 
period in the component <code>history</code> of the returned list.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sort</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code> sort the results by rating (highest
to lowest). If <code>FALSE</code> sort the results by player.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Passed to the function <code>kfac</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Elo rating system is a simple method for evaluating the skill 
of players. It has been used since around 1960 and is still
employed in various settings. Although the basic form uses only 
the ratings, additional complexity is commonly introduced
by adding a player one advantage parameter and by using different
K factors. A player one advantage parameter has been added to the 
original definition in the reference. A player one advantage 
parameter is also used for prediction purposes in 
<code>predict.rating</code>.
</p>
<p>This implementation uses default arguments that are consistent 
with the implementation of FIDE for rating chess players.
It does not employ the initialization used by FIDE. For the
chess data analyzed in the file doc/ChessRatings.pdf, prediction
performance is poor because the default values of the K factors
are too low. This can be altered using the <code>kv</code> argument 
which is passed to the function <code>kfide</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list object of class <code>"rating"</code> with the following 
components
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ratings</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame of the results at the end of the 
final time period. The variables are self explanatory except
for <code>Lag</code>, which represents the number of time periods
since the player last played a game, <code>Elite</code>, which
is a binary indicator for whether or not a player has ever
reached 2400, and <code>Opponent</code>, which gives the average 
rating of all opponents. The <code>Lag</code> variable is equal 
to zero for players who played in the latest time period, 
and is also zero for players who have not yet played any 
games. The <code>Elite</code> variable is required due to the 
K factor dependency in the FIDE implementation. The
<code>Opponent</code> variable is not currently used in the
updating algorithm.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>history</code></td>
<td>
<p>A three dimensional array, or <code>NULL</code> if 
<code>history</code> is <code>FALSE</code>. The row dimension is the 
players, the column dimension is the time periods. 
The third dimension gives different parameters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gamma</code></td>
<td>
<p>The player one advantage parameter.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>kfac</code></td>
<td>
<p>The K factor or K factor function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>The character string <code>"Elo"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
