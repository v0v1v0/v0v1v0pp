<h2>pcds.ugraph: A package for the Underlying and Reflexivity Graphs of the Proximity Catch Digraphs and Their Applications</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>pcds.ugraph</code> is a package for construction and visualization of the underlying graphs based on
proximity catch digraphs and for computation of edge density of these graphs for testing spatial patterns.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The PCD families considered are Arc-Slice PCDs,
Proportional-Edge PCDs and Central Similarity PCDs
(Ceyhan (2005); Ceyhan et al. (2006); Ceyhan et al. (2007)).
</p>
<p>The graph invariant used in testing spatial point data are the edge density of
the underlying and reflexivity graphs of the PCDs
(see Ceyhan (2016)).
</p>
<p>The package also contains visualization tools for these graphs for 1D-3D vertices.
The AS-PCD and CS-PCD related tools are provided for 1D and 2D data;
PE-PCD related tools are provided for 1D-3D data.
</p>


<h3>The <code>pcds.ugraph</code> functions</h3>

<p>The <code>pcds.ugraph</code> functions can be grouped as AS-PCD Functions, PE-PCD Functions,
and CS-PCD Functions.
</p>


<h3>Arc-Slice PCD Functions</h3>

<p>Contains the functions used in AS-PCD construction and computation of edge density of
the corresponding underlying and reflexivity graph.
</p>


<h3>Proportional-Edge PCD Functions</h3>

<p>Contains the functions used in PE-PCD construction and computation of edge density of
the corresponding underlying and reflexivity graph.
</p>


<h3>Central-Similarity PCD Functions</h3>

<p>Contains the functions used in CS-PCD construction and computation of edge density of
the corresponding underlying and reflexivity graph.
