<h2>Reads contributed by each pool</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function simulates the contribution, in terms of reads, of each pool.
The number of reads contributed from all pools is equal to the total coverage
of the population.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">poolReads(nPools, coverage, probs)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nPools</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer indicating how many pools were used to sequence the
population.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>coverage</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector containing the total depth of coverage of the
population. Each entry of the vector represents a different site.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>probs</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix containing the probability of contribution of each pool
used to sequence the population. This matrix can be obtained with the
<code>poolProbs</code> function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a matrix with the number of reads contributed by each pool towards
the total coverage of the population. Each row of the matrix is a different
pool and each column a different site.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># simulate the probability of contribution of each pool
probs &lt;- poolProbs(nPools = 5, vector_np = rep(10, 5), nSNPs = 8, pError = 50)

# simulate the number of reads contributed, assuming 10x coverage for each site
poolReads(nPools = 5, coverage = rep(10, 8), probs = probs)
