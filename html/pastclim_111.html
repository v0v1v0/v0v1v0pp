<h3>Description</h3>

<p>WorldClim version 2.1 is a database of high spatial resolution global weather and
climate data, covering both the present and future projections.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>IMPORTANT: If you use this
dataset, make sure to cite the original publication:

<p><strong>Present-day reconstructions</strong> are based on the mean for the period 1970-2000,
and are available at multiple resolutions of
10 arc-minutes, 5 arc-minutes, 2.5 arc-minute and 0.5 arc-minutes. The resolution
of interest can be obtained by changing the ending of the dataset name
<em>WorldClim_2.1_RESm</em>, e.g. <em>WorldClim_2.1_10m</em> or <em>WorldClim_2.1_5m</em>
(currently, only 10m and 5m are currently available in <code>pastclim</code>). In <code>pastclim</code>, the datasets are given
a date of 1985 CE (the mid-point of the period of interest). There are 19 “bioclimatic” variables, as well as monthly
estimates for minimum, mean, and maximum temperature, and precipitation.
</p>
<p><strong>Future projections</strong> are based on the models in CMIP6, downscaled and de-biased
using WorldClim 2.1 for the present as a baseline. Monthly values of minimum
temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation, as well as 19 bioclimatic
variables were processed for
23 global climate models (GCMs), and for four
Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs): 126, 245, 370 and 585. Model and
SSP can be chosen by changing the ending of the dataset name
<em>WorldClim_2.1_GCM_SSP_RESm</em>.
</p>
<p>Available values for GCM are: "ACCESS-CM2",
"BCC-CSM2-MR", "CMCC-ESM2", "EC-Earth3-Veg", "FIO-ESM-2-0",
"GFDL-ESM4", "GISS-E2-1-G", "HadGEM3-GC31-LL", "INM-CM5-0", "IPSL-CM6A-LR",
"MIROC6", "MPI-ESM1-2-HR", "MRI-ESM2-0", and "UKESM1-0-LL". For SSP, use: "ssp126",
"ssp245",	"ssp370",	and "ssp585". RES takes the same values as for present reconstructions
(i.e. "10m", "5m", "2.5m", and "0.5m"). Example dataset names are
<em>WorldClim_2.1_ACCESS-CM2_ssp245_10m</em> and <em>WorldClim_2.1_MRI-ESM2-0_ssp370_5m</em>.
Four combination (namely <em>FIO-ESM-2-0_ssp370</em>, <em>GFDL-ESM4_ssp245</em>,
<em>GFDL-ESM4_ssp585</em>, and <em>HadGEM3-GC31-LL_ssp370</em>) are NOT available.
</p>
<p>The dataset are averages over 20 year
periods (2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2061-2080, 2081-2100).
In <code>pastclim</code>, the midpoints of the periods (2030, 2050, 2070, 2090) are used as the time stamps. All 4 periods
are automatically downloaded for each combination of GCM model and SSP, and are selected
as usual by defining the time in functions such as <code>region_slice()</code>.
