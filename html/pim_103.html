<h2>The pim.poset class</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The pim.poset class is an S4 class that inherits from <code>environment</code>
and contains the poset functions for a <code>pim</code>. It's a class
used internally and should not be adapted by the user. The correct
interpretation of the formula is dependent on this object. The object
mainly functions as a slot in object of class 
<code>pim.environment</code>.
</p>


<h3>Slots</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>compare</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a character value with the type of poset. This can
take the values "unique", "all" and "custom".</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>nobs</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>an integer value describing the number of observations 
for which this poset is meant to be used.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The pim.poset class doesn't really make sense to be used on itself.
It is part of the <code>pim.environment</code> class and shouldn't
be used outside this context.
