<h2>Matching Methods for Causal Inference with Time-Series Cross-Sectional Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements a set of methodological tools
that enable researchers to apply matching methods to
time-series cross-sectional data. Imai, Kim, and Wang
(2023) proposes a nonparametric generalization of the
difference-in-differences estimator, which does not rely
on the linearity assumption as often done in
practice. Researchers first select a method of matching
each treated observation for a given unit in a
particular time period with control observations from
other units in the same time period that have a similar
treatment and covariate history. These methods include
standard matching methods based on propensity score and
Mahalanobis distance, as well as weighting methods. Once 
matching is done, both short-term and long-term average 
treatment effects for the treated can be estimated with 
standard errors. The package also offers a visualization 
technique that allows researchers to assess the quality 
of matches by examining the resulting covariate balance.
