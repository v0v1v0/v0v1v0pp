<h2>Pre- and postcondition checking (assertions)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The assertions described here are similar in functionality to the base R
function <code>base::stopifnot()</code>, but focusing on better diagnostics, safer
behavior, and customizability.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>precondition()</code> fails with diagnosis if its arguments do not evaluate as
<code>TRUE</code>. Use this assertion function to check function arguments or data
inputs against code invariants.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>postcondition()</code> is as above, but the assertion is performed when the
calling function successfully returns. Use this assertion to check that
the function has produced a well-formed result (via base::returnValue ()) or behavior.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>sanity_check()</code> is as above, but the program execution will immediately
terminate via <code>fatal_error()</code>, bypassing R's error-checking mechanisms.
Use this predicate to validate critical internal assumptions your code
relies upon. Failing a sanity check means that your program contains an
unrecoverable logical error and cannot reasonably continue execution.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To facilitate debugging, the assertions used with these functions can be
enhanced with debug markers. This enables informative error messages and
makes it easier to understand why the assertion has failed. First,
assertions can include custom informative messages, supplied via literal
string arguments to the assertion function. Second, key parts of the
assertion expression can be wrapped in curly braces(e.g. <code>{x} &gt; 0</code>). If the
assertion fails, the values marked in such way will be diagnosed and
displayed as a separate entry in the error message. See the examples on how
to use these features and the details section how to implement even more
custom functionality.
</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances these predicates might evaluate the assertion expression
multiple times. Beware of combining them with side effects.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">precondition(...)

postcondition(...)

sanity_check(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>one or more expressions to check (with optional assertion messages)</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A precondition is an assertion that specifies a set of conditions that must
be true in order for the execution to proceed in a meaningful way. This is
usually conditioned on the user input or environment in some way. A
postcondition is an assertion that must be true if a function has executed
in a meaningful way. Pre- and postconditions explicitly state the contract
of a function and make it easier to debug correct function usage. Note:
<code>postcondition(check)</code> is similar to <code>on.exit(stopifnot(check))</code>, except
that the postcondition will not be checked if an error occurred during
function execution.
</p>
<p>A sanity check is an assertion that specifies a set of conditions that the
program implicitly assumes to be true. A sanity check failure means that the
core logic of the program is broken and error recovery is either impossible
or not meaningful. Sanity checks are used to test the internal logic of your
code and will result in an immediate program termination if failed (via
fatal_error).
</p>
<p>The arguments to these assertion functions are either expressions that should
evaluate to <code>TRUE</code> or literal string constants containing informative
messages (e.g. <code>sanity_check("x is not NULL", !is.null(x))</code>). Should the
assertion fail, the provided message will be displayed. Note that this
message <em>must</em> be a string literal, you cannot compute it or use a variable.
The following will not work correctly: 'sanity_check(paste0("x is
not", "NULL"), !is.null(x)).
</p>
<p>Assertion expression support debug-markers. See <code>diagnose_assertion_failure()</code>
on how to implement custom assertion helpers.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>TRUE</code> on assertion success, raises an error of class
<code>precondition/assertion_error</code> on assertion failure
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># These examples are guarded to avoid throwing errors
if (FALSE) {

# function contract is accepting a positive value and returning up to 20
fun &lt;- function(x) { 
  precondition("`x` should be positive", {x} &gt; 0)
  postcondition(returnValue() &lt;= 20)

  out &lt;- x*2
  sanity_check("twice `x` is larger than `x`", {out} &gt; {x})

  out
}

fun(5)
fun(0)
fun(10)
}
</code></pre>
