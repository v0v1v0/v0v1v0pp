<h2>A what-if forecast is a forecast that is created from a modified version
of the baseline forecast</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A what-if forecast is a forecast that is created from a modified version of the baseline forecast. Each what-if forecast incorporates either a replacement dataset or a set of transformations to the original dataset.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/forecastservice_create_what_if_forecast/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/forecastservice_create_what_if_forecast/</a> for full documentation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">forecastservice_create_what_if_forecast(
  WhatIfForecastName,
  WhatIfAnalysisArn,
  TimeSeriesTransformations = NULL,
  TimeSeriesReplacementsDataSource = NULL,
  Tags = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>WhatIfForecastName</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The name of the what-if forecast. Names must be unique within each
what-if analysis.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>WhatIfAnalysisArn</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the what-if analysis.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>TimeSeriesTransformations</code></td>
<td>
<p>The transformations that are applied to the baseline time series. Each
transformation contains an action and a set of conditions. An action is
applied only when all conditions are met. If no conditions are provided,
the action is applied to all items.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>TimeSeriesReplacementsDataSource</code></td>
<td>
<p>The replacement time series dataset, which contains the rows that you
want to change in the related time series dataset. A replacement time
series does not need to contain all rows that are in the baseline
related time series. Include only the rows (measure-dimension
combinations) that you want to include in the what-if forecast.
</p>
<p>This dataset is merged with the original time series to create a
transformed dataset that is used for the what-if analysis.
</p>
<p>This dataset should contain the items to modify (such as item_id or
workforce_type), any relevant dimensions, the timestamp column, and at
least one of the related time series columns. This file should not
contain duplicate timestamps for the same time series.
</p>
<p>Timestamps and item_ids not included in this dataset are not included in
the what-if analysis.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Tags</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/tagging-forecast-resources.html">tags</a>
to apply to the what if forecast.</p>
</td>
