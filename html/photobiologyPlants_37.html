<h2>ZTL absorbance spectra.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing the wavelengths at an arbitrary nm interval. Tabulated
values for the in vitro absorbance spectrum of ZTL LOV2 domain from
Arabidopsis measured in vitro. Data were digitized from figure
2B in Zoltowski and Imaizumi (2014).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>filter_mspct</code> with five member <code>filter_spct</code> objects each
with 300 rows and 2 numeric variables, <code>w.length</code> and <code>A</code>
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The variables of the member spectra are as follows:
</p>
 <ul>
<li>
<p> w.length (nm) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A (spectral absorbance) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>If you use these data in a publication, please cite also the original
source as given under references in addition to this package.
