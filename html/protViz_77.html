<h2>NanoLC pressure profile</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>pressureProfile is a data frame with a variable number of 
cases (rows) and two variables (columns) named time(min), Pc(psi)
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>pressureProfile</code> data set gives the flow profile in nL/min and 
the pressure profile in psi as a function of time, respectively, for 24 
consecutive injections on an Eksigent NanoLC-Ultra 1D plus system.
</p>
<p>The dataset consists of 24 HPLC pressure profiles of 140 min. Data was 
acquired with a Eksigent NanoLC-Ultra 1D plus system. Samples were 
separated with a 100 1E-6m ID. column of 150 mm lenght packed with C-18 
AQ 200A beads (Dr. Maisch GmbH). The column was heated to a temperature 
of 50 grad C during the entire run. Acquisition queue was as follows:
</p>
<p>- A block of three (3) samples with a gradient length of 140 min was 
allways followed a autocalibration run with a gradient length of 25 min.
</p>
<p>- A total of seven (7) such blocks was acquired to cover the entire 
dataset.
