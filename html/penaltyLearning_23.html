<h2>
Processed neuroblastoma data set with features and targets
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Features are inputs and targets are outputs for
penalty learning functions like penaltyLearning::IntervalRegressionCV.
data(neuroblastoma, package="neuroblastoma") was processed by
computing optimal Gaussian segmentation models from 1 to 20 segments
(cghseg:::segmeanCO or Segmentor3IsBack::Segmentor), then label error
was computed using neuroblastoma$annotations
(penaltyLearning::labelError), then target intervals were
computed (penaltyLearning::targetInterval). Features were also
computed based on neuroblastoma$profiles.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("neuroblastomaProcessed")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>List of two matrices: feature.mat is n.observations x n.features, and
target.mat is n.observations x 2, where n.observations=3418 and
n.features=117.
