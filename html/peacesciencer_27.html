<h2>Add UCDP onsets to state-year data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_ucdp_onsets()</code> allows you to add information about conflict episode onsets from the UCDP
data program to state-year data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_ucdp_onsets(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a  state-year data frame</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function leans on attributes of the data that are provided by the <code>create_dyadyear()</code> or
<code>create_stateyear()</code> function. Make sure that function (or data created by that function) appear at the top
of the proverbial pipe. The underlying data are version 19.1. Importantly, the UCDP yearly onset data are nominally state-year,
but technically state-dyad-episode-year for cases of onsets. For example, there are four France-1946 observations because of four
new conflict episodes with Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. There are two Panama-1989 episodes, one for the invasion by
the United States and another for a failed coup attempt. That means the are duplicates in the original data that I process
into summaries. The user will probably want to consider some kind of recoding here.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_ucdp_onsets()</code> takes a state-year data frame and adds a few summary
variables based off armed conflict onsets data provided by UCDP. The variables returned are
the sum of new conflict dyads (should they exist) in a given state-year, and the sum of new onset episodes (or new conflicts) that are
separated by one, two, three, five, or 10 years since the last conflict episode.
