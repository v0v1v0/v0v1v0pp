<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The user will want to be a little careful with how some of these data are used, beyond the typical caveat
about how difficult it is to pin-point how many thousands of coal-tons a state like Baden was producing in the 19th century.
</p>
<p>First, military expenditures are denominated in British pounds sterling for observations between 1816 and 1913. The observations
from 1914 and beyond are denominated in current United States dollars. This is according to the manual.
</p>
<p>Second, urban population size is an estimate based on, well, an estimate of the size of the population living in an area with 100,000
or more people.
</p>
<p>Third, the Composite Index of National Capability score is calculated as each state's world share of each of the six composite indicators
also included in the data in a given year. It theoretically is bound between 0 and 1. A state with a 1 is 100% responsible for 1) all of the military expenditures
in the world, 2) is the only state with a military, 3) does all the iron and steel production, 4) all the world's primary energy consumption, and 5)
is the only state in the world with a population and an urban population. Incidentally, the maximum scores observed in the data belong to the United States in 1945.
