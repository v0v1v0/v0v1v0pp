<h2>Polya Sampling from an Urn</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Consider an urn containing a finite set of values.
An item is selected at random from the urn.  Then it is returned
to the urn along with another item with the same value.  Next
a value is selected at random from the reconstituted urn
and it and a copy our returned to the urn.  This process is
repeated until <code class="reqn">k</code> additional items have been added to the
original urn.  The original composition of the urn along with the selected
values, in order, are returned.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">polyap(ysamp, k)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ysamp</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of real numbers which make up the urn.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive integer which specifies the number of items
added to the original composition of the urn.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The returned value is a vector of length equal to the length of
<code>ysamp</code> plus <code>k</code>.</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">polyap(c(0,1),20)
</code></pre>
