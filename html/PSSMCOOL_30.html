<h2>PSSM-SD feature</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In this feature, by considering a specific column, at first sum of all components in this column
is denoted by "L", then starting from the first row in this column, the components are added together to
reaching a value less than or equal to 25
is calculated and stored . In the next step, the same work is done starting from the first row to reaching a
value less than or equal to 50
is done started from the last row, To reaching 25
By appending these saved numbers together for each column, a vector of length 4 is obtained. If this is done
for all the columns and the obtained vectors are connected to each other, for each protein, a feature vector
of length 80 is obtained which its name is PSSM-SD.
