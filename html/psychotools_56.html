<h2>Calculation of the Elementary Symmetric Functions and Their
Derivatives</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculation of <code>elementary_symmetric_functions</code> (ESFs), their first and,
in the case of dichotomous items, second derivatives with sum or
difference algorithm for the Rasch, rating scale and partial credit
model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">elementary_symmetric_functions(par, order = 0L, log = TRUE,
  diff = FALSE, engine = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>par</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector or a list. Either a vector of item difficulty
parameters of dichotomous items (Rasch  model) or a list of
item-category parameters of polytomous items (rating scale and
partial credit model).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>order</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer between 0 and 2, specifying up to which derivative
the ESFs should be calculated. Please note, second order derivatives
are currently only possible for dichtomous items in an R
implementation <code>engine == "R".</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>log</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. Are the parameters given in <code>par</code> on log
scale? Primarily used for internal recursive calls of
<code>elementary_symmetric_functions</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>diff</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. Should the first and second derivatives (if
requested) of the ESFs calculated with sum (<code>FALSE</code>)
or difference algorithm (<code>TRUE</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>engine</code></td>
<td>
<p>character, either <code>"C"</code> or <code>"R"</code>. If the
former, a C implementation is used to calculcate the ESFs and their
derivatives, otherwise (<code>"R"</code>) pure R code is used.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Depending on the type of <code>par</code>, the elementary symmetric
functions for dichotomous (<code>par</code> is a numeric vector) or
polytomous items (<code>par</code> is a list) are calculated.
</p>
<p>For dichotomous items, the summation and difference algorithm
published in Liou (1994) is used. For calculating the second order
derivatives, the equations proposed by Jansens (1984) are employed.
</p>
<p>For polytomous items, the summation and difference algorithm published
by Fischer and Pococny (1994) is used (see also Fischer and Pococny,
1995).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>elementary_symmetric_function</code> returns a list of length 1 + <code>order</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>order = 0</code>, then the first (and only) element is a numeric
vector with the ESFs of order 0 to the maximum score possible with
the given parameters.
</p>
<p>If <code>order = 1</code>, the second element of the list contains a
matrix, with the rows corresponding to the possible scores and the
columns corresponding to the derivatives with respect to the i-th
parameter of <code>par</code>.
</p>
<p>For dichotomous items and <code>order = 2</code>, the third element of the
list contains an array with the second derivatives with respect to
every possible combination of two parameters given in <code>par</code>. The
rows of the individual matrices still correspond to the possibles
scores (orders) starting from zero.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
 ## zero and first order derivatives of 100 dichotomous items
 di &lt;- rnorm(100)
 system.time(esfC &lt;- elementary_symmetric_functions(di, order = 1))
 
 ## again with R implementation
 system.time(esfR &lt;- elementary_symmetric_functions(di, order = 1,
 engine = "R"))

 ## are the results equal?
 all.equal(esfC, esfR)


 ## calculate zero and first order elementary symmetric functions
 ## for 10 polytomous items with three categories each.
 pi &lt;- split(rnorm(20), rep(1:10, each = 2))
 x &lt;- elementary_symmetric_functions(pi)

 ## use difference algorithm instead and compare results
 y &lt;- elementary_symmetric_functions(pi, diff = TRUE)
 all.equal(x, y)
