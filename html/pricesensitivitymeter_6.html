<h2>
Weighted van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter Analysis (PSM)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>psm_analysis_weighted()</code> performs a <b>weighted</b> analysis
of consumer price preferences and price sensitivity known as
<b>van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter (PSM)</b>. The function
requires a sample design from the <span class="pkg">survey</span> package as the
main input. Custom weights or sample designs from other packages
are not supported.
</p>
<p>To run a PSM analysis <b>without</b> weighting, use the function
<code>psm_analysis</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">psm_analysis_weighted(
  toocheap, cheap, expensive, tooexpensive,
  design,
  validate = TRUE,
  interpolate = FALSE,
  interpolation_steps = 0.01,
  intersection_method = "min",
  acceptable_range = "original",
  pi_cheap = NA, pi_expensive = NA,
  pi_scale = 5:1,
  pi_calibrated = c(0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0),
  pi_calibrated_toocheap = 0, pi_calibrated_tooexpensive = 0
  )
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>toocheap, cheap, expensive, tooexpensive</code></td>
<td>
<p>Names
of the variables in the data.frame/matrix that contain the
survey data on the respondents' "too cheap", "cheap",
"expensive" and "too expensive" price preferences.
</p>
<p>If the <code>toocheap</code> price was not assessed, a
variable of NAs can be used instead.  If <code>toocheap</code>
is NA for all cases, it is possible to calculate the Point of
Marginal Expensiveness and the Indifference Price Point, but it
is impossible to calculate the Point of Marginal Cheapness and
the Optimal Price Point.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>design</code></td>
<td>
<p>A survey design which has been created by the
function <code>svydesign()</code> from the <span class="pkg">survey</span>
package. The data that is used as an input of <code>svydesign()</code>
must include all the variable names for <code>toocheap</code>,
<code>cheap</code>, <code>expensive</code> and <code>tooexpensive</code> variables
specified above.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>validate</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. should only respondents with
consistent price preferences (too cheap &lt; cheap &lt; expensive
&lt; too expensive) be considered in the analysis?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>interpolate</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. should interpolation of the price
curves be applied between the actual prices given by the
respondents? If interpolation is enabled, the output appears
less bumpy in regions with sparse price information. If the
sample size is sufficiently large, interpolation should not
be necessary.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>interpolation_steps</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric. if <code>interpolate</code> is
<code>TRUE</code>: the size of the interpolation steps. Set by
default to 0.01, which should be appropriate for most goods
in a price range of 0-50 USD/Euro.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>intersection_method</code></td>
<td>
<p>"min" (default), "max", "mean" or
"median". defines the method how to determine the price
points (range, indifference price, optimal price) if there
are multiple possible intersections of the price curves.
"min" uses the lowest possible prices, "max" uses the
highest possible prices, "mean" calculates the mean among
all intersections and "median" uses the median of all
possible intersections</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>acceptable_range</code></td>
<td>
<p>"original" (default) or "narrower".
Defines which intersection is used to calculate the point of
marginal cheapness and point of marginal expensiveness, which
together form the range of acceptable prices. "original"
uses the definition provided in van Westendorp's paper:
The lower end of the price range (point of marginal
cheapness) is defined as the intersection of "too cheap"
and the inverse of the "cheap" curve. The upper end of the
price range (point of marginal expensiveness) is defined
as the intersection of "too expensive" and the inverse of
the "expensive" curve. Alternatively, it is possible to use
a "narrower" definition which is applied by some market
research companies. Here, the lower end of the price range
is defined as the intersection of the "expensive" and the
"too cheap" curves and the upper end of the price range is
defined as the intersection of the "too expensive" and the
"cheap" curves. This leads to a narrower range of acceptable
prices. Note that it is possible that the optimal price
according to the Newton/Miller/Smith extension is higher
than the upper end of the acceptable price range in the
"narrower" definition.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pi_cheap, pi_expensive</code></td>
<td>
<p>Only required for the Newton
Miller Smith extension. Names of the variables in the data
that contain the survey data on the respondents' purchase
intent at their individual cheap/expensive price.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pi_scale</code></td>
<td>
<p>Only required for the Newton Miller Smith
extension. Scale of the purchase intent variables pi_cheap and
pi_expensive. By default assuming a five-point scale with 5
indicating the highest purchase intent.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pi_calibrated</code></td>
<td>
<p>Only required for the Newton Miller Smith
extension. Calibrated purchase probabilities that are assumed
for each value of the purchase intent scale. Must be the same
order as the pi_scale variable so that the first value of
pi_calibrated corresponds to the first value in the pi_scale
variable. Default values are taken from the Sawtooth Software
PSM implementation in Excel: 70% for the best value of the
purchase intent scale, 50% for the second best value,
30% for the third best value (middle of the scale), 10%
for the fourth best value and 0% for the worst value.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pi_calibrated_toocheap, pi_calibrated_tooexpensive</code></td>
<td>

<p>Only required for the Newton Miller Smith extension. Calibrated
purchase probabilities for the "too cheap" and the "too
expensive" price, respectively. Must be a value between 0 and
1; by default set to zero following the logic in van
Westendorp's paper.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The main logic of the Price Sensitivity Meter Analysis is
explained in the documentation of the <code>psm_analysis</code>
function. The <code>psm_analysis_weighted</code> performs the same
analysis, but weights the survey data according to a known
population.</p>
