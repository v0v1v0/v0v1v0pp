<h2>Apple Hardness</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An experiment was undertaken where seventeen recently picked (<code>Fresh</code>)
apples were randomly selected and measured for hardness.  Seventeen apples
were also randomly selected from a warehouse (<code>Warehouse</code>) where the
apples had been stored for one week. Data are used in Example 8.10.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 17 observations on the following 2 variables:
#' </p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>Fresh</code> (hardness rating measured in <code class="reqn">\texttt{kg}/\texttt{meter}^2</code>) 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Warehouse</code> (hardness rating measured in <code class="reqn">\texttt{kg}/\texttt{meter}^2</code>)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
