</li>
<li> <p><code>pending</code> - The Capacity Reservation request was successful but
the capacity provisioning is still pending.

</li>
<li> <p><code>failed</code> - The Capacity Reservation request has failed. A

that the Capacity Reservation accepts. The options include:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>open</code> - The Capacity Reservation accepts all instances that

launch into the Capacity Reservation automatically without
specifying any additional parameters.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>targeted</code> - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances
that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and
Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity
