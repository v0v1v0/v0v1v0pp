<h2>GPA and chronic cheating (sample data)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Dichotomous responses by 319 undergraduates to four questions about cheating behavior, and each student's academic GPA.  
</p>
<p>Students responded either (1) no or (2) yes as to whether they had ever lied to avoid taking an exam (<code>LIEEXAM</code>), lied to avoid handing a term paper in on time (<code>LIEPAPER</code>), purchased a term paper to hand in as their own or had obtained a copy of an exam prior to taking the exam (<code>FRAUD</code>), or copied answers during an exam from someone sitting near to them (<code>COPYEXAM</code>).
</p>
<p>The <code>GPA</code> variable is partitioned into five groups: (1) 2.99 or less; (2) 3.00-3.25; (3) 3.26-3.50; (4) 3.51-3.75; (5) 3.76-4.00.
</p>
<p>This data set appears in Dayton (1998, pp. 33 and 85) as Tables 3.4 and 7.1.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(cheating)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 319 observations on 5 variables. Note: GPA data were not available for four students who reported never cheating.</p>
