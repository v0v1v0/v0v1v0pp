<h2>Fat Cats</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In a weight loss study on obese cats, overweight cats were randomly assigned to one of three groups and boarded in a kennel.  In each of the three groups, the cats' total caloric intake was strictly controlled (1 cup of generic cat food) and monitored for 10 days. The difference between the groups was that group A was given 1/4 of a cup of cat food every six hours, group B was given 1/3 a cup of cat food every eight hours, and group C was given 1/2 a cup of cat food every twelve hours. The weights of the cats at the beginning and end of the study were recorded, and the difference in weights (grams) was stored in the variable <code>Weight</code> of the data frame <code>FCD</code>.
</p>
