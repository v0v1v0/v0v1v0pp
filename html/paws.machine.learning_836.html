<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SourceArn</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The ARN of the source.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>DestinationArn</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>AssociationType</code></td>
<td>
<p>The type of association. The following are suggested uses for each type.
Amazon SageMaker places no restrictions on their use.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> ContributedTo - The source contributed to the destination or had a
part in enabling the destination. For example, the training data
contributed to the training job.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> AssociatedWith - The source is connected to the destination. For
example, an approval workflow is associated with a model deployment.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> DerivedFrom - The destination is a modification of the source. For
example, a digest output of a channel input for a processing job is
derived from the original inputs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Produced - The source generated the destination. For example, a
training job produced a model artifact.
