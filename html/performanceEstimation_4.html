<h2>
CD diagrams for the post-hoc Boferroni-Dunn test
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function obtains a Critical Difference (CD) diagram for the
post-hoc Bonferroni-Dunn test along the lines defined by Demsar (2006). These
diagrams provide an interesting visualization of the statistical
significance of the observed paired differences between a set of
workflows and a selected baseline wrokflow. They allow us to compare a
set of alternative workflows against this baseline and answer the
question whether the differences are statisticall y significant.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">CDdiagram.BD(r, metric = names(r)[1])
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>r</code></td>
<td>

<p>A list resulting from a call to <code>pairedComparisons</code>
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>metric</code></td>
<td>

<p>The metric for which the CD diagram will be obtained (defaults to the
first metric of the comparison).
</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Critical Difference (CD) diagrams are interesting sucint
visualizations of the results of a Bonferroni-Dunn post-hoc test that is
designed to check the statistical significance between the differences
in average rank of a set of workflows against a baseline workflow, on
a set of predictive tasks.
</p>
<p>In the resulting graph each workflow is represented by a colored
line. The X axis where the lines end represents the average rank position
of the respective workflow across all tasks. The null hypothesis is that
the average rank of a baseline workflow does not differ with
statistical significance (at some confidence level defined in the call
to <code>pairedComparisons</code> that creates the object used to
obtain these graphs) from the average ranks of a set of
alternative workflows. An horizontal line connects the baseline
workflow with the alternative workflows for which we cannot reject
this hypothesis. This means that only the alternative workflows that
are not connect with the baseline can be considered as having an
average rank that is different from the one of the baseline with
statistical significance. To help spotting these differences the name
of the baseline workflow is shown in bold, and the names of the
alternative workflows whose difference is significant are shown in
italics.

<p>Nothing, the graph is draw on the current device.
