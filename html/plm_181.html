<h2>Simes Test for unit roots in panel data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simes' test of intersection of individual hypothesis tests
(Simes (1986)) applied to panel unit root tests as
suggested by Hanck (2013).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">phansitest(object, alpha = 0.05)

## S3 method for class 'phansitest'
print(x, cutoff = 10L, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>either a numeric containing p-values of individual unit root
test results (does not need to be sorted) or a suitable <code>purtest</code> object
(as produced by <code>purtest()</code> for a test which gives p-values of the individuals
(Hadri's test in <code>purtest</code> is not suitable)),</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric, the pre-specified significance level (defaults to <code>0.05</code>),</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class <code>c("phansitest", "list")</code> as produced by
<code>phansitest</code> to be printed,</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cutoff</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer, cutoff value for printing of enumeration of individuals
with rejected individual H0, for print method only,</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>further arguments (currently not used).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Simes' approach to testing is combining p-values from single hypothesis tests
with a global (intersected) hypothesis. Hanck (2013)
mentions it can be applied to any panel unit root test which yields a p-value
for each individual series.
The test is robust versus general patterns of cross-sectional dependence.
</p>
<p>Further, this approach allows to discriminate between individuals for which
the individual H0 (unit root present for individual series) is rejected/is
not rejected by Hommel's procedure (Hommel (1988)) for
family-wise error rate control (FWER) at a pre-specified significance level
<code class="reqn">\alpha</code> via argument <code>alpha</code> (defaulting to <code>0.05</code>), i.e., it controls
for the multiplicity in testing.
</p>
<p>The function <code>phansitest</code> takes as main input <code>object</code> either a plain numeric
containing p-values of individual tests or a <code>purtest</code> object which holds
a suitable pre-computed panel unit root test (one that produces p-values per
individual series).
</p>
<p>The function's return value (see section Value) is a list with detailed
evaluation of the applied Simes test.
</p>
<p>The associated <code>print</code> method prints a verbal evaluation.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>For <code>phansitest</code>, an object of class <code>c("phansitest", "list")</code> which
is a list with the elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>id</code>: integer, the identifier of the individual (integer sequence referring to
position in input),
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>name</code>: character, name of the input's individual (if it has a name,
otherwise "1", "2", "3", ...),
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>p</code>: numeric, p-values as input (either the numeric or extracted from
the purtest object),
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>p.hommel</code>: numeric, p-values after Hommel's transformation,
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>rejected</code>: logical, indicating for which individual the individual null
hypothesis is rejected (<code>TRUE</code>)/non-rejected (<code>FALSE</code>) (after controlling
for multiplicity),
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>rejected.no</code>: integer, giving the total number of rejected individual series,
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>alpha</code>: numeric, the input <code>alpha</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
