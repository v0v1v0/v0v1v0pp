<h2>Imputed Patient Visit Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a series of weekly clinic visits described per protocol,
this data marks subjects as present or missing.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(derived_visitImputed)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A tibble with 87,891 rows and
columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>who</dt>
<dd>
<p>Patient ID</p>
</dd>
<dt>when</dt>
<dd>
<p>Study day</p>
</dd>
<dt>visitImputed</dt>
<dd>
<p>Marked as <code>"Present"</code> if the subject visited the clinic on that day,
or <code>"Missing"</code> if the subject did not visit the clinic on a day we
would have expected them to (based on regular weekly visits).
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This contains planned visits. Not all appointments were kept. We
indicate if an appointment was kept on a certain day by marking the
subject as <code>"Present"</code> on that day. If the subject goes more than 7 days
without a clinic visit, we mark the subject as <code>"Missing"</code> on days that
are multiples of 7 from the randomization day. For subjects without a
randomization day, weekly visits after day of consent are marked as
<code>"Missing"</code> instead. This data set is a derived data set; the script used
to create it is <code>"scripts/create_visitImputed_20210909.R"</code>.
</p>
<p>NOTE: because our window is a strict weekly window, a subject who shows
up for their clinic visit one or more days late will still be marked as
missing on the day they were supposed to appear. This means that some
subjects will be marked as having missed their weekly clinic visit on one
day, but be present in the clinic the next.
