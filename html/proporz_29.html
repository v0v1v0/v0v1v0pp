<h2>Calculate upper apportionment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In the upper apportionment, the seats for each party are computed with a highest averages
method. This determines how many of all seats each party deserves due to the total of all
their votes (that is the sum of the votes for all regional lists of that party).
Analogical, the same highest averages method is used to determine how many of all seats
each region deserves.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">upper_apportionment(
  votes_matrix,
  district_seats,
  use_list_votes = TRUE,
  method = "round"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>votes_matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vote count matrix with votes by party in rows and votes by district
in columns</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>district_seats</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector defining the number of seats per district. Must be the same
length as <code>ncol(votes_matrix)</code>. Values are name-matched to <code>votes_matrix</code> if both are
named. If the number of seats per district should be assigned according to the number
of votes (not the general use case), a single number for the total number of seats can
be used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>use_list_votes</code></td>
<td>
<p>By default (<code>TRUE</code>) it's assumed that each voter in a district has
as many votes as there are seats in a district. Thus, votes are weighted according to
the number of available district seats with <code>weight_list_votes()</code>. Set to <code>FALSE</code> if
<code>votes_matrix</code> shows the number of voters (e.g. they can only cast one vote for one
party).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Apportion method that defines how seats are assigned, see <code>proporz()</code>. Default
is the SaintÃ«-Lague/Webster method.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A named list with district seats (for <code>votes_matrix</code> columns) and party seats
(for rows).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The results from the upper apportionment are final results for the number of the
seats of one party (and analogically for the number of the seats of one region) within
the whole voting area, the lower apportionment will only determine where (which
regions) the party seats are allocated. Thus, after the upper apportionment is done,
the final strength of a party/region within the parliament is definite.
