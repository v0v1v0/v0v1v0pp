<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is designed to be used for the <code>kfac</code> argument
of either <code>fide</code> or <code>elo</code>. It returns
<code>kv[1]</code> for elite players, <code>kv[2]</code> for non-elite
players with 30 games or more, and <code>kv[3]</code> for non-elite
players with less than 30 games. The default is the current FIDE 
implementation which uses the K factors 10, 15 and 30. The K factor 
of 30 was changed from 25 in the year 2011. In this context, elite
players are defined by FIDE as being those who have reached 
the rating 2400 or more at any time in the past.
