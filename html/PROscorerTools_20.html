<h2>PROscorerTools</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Tools to score Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO), Quality
of Life (QOL), and other psychometric measures and
questionnaire-based instruments.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Provides a set of reliable and flexible tools to score PRO, QOL, and
other psychometric and psychological measures.  Additionally,
<span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span> provides the infrastructure for the scoring functions
in the <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> package.
</p>
<p>The <code>scoreScale</code> function is the workhorse of
<span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span>, and it can be used to score most single-scale
measures. For example, it can reverse code some or all items before
scoring, and it can generate different types of scores (sum scores, mean
scores, or scores scaled to range from 0 to 100).  It and the other
<span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span> functions can be used together to flexibly write new
functions that score more complex, multi-scale measures.
</p>
<p>The <code>scoreScale</code> function itself is composed of other
<span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span> helper functions.  This is an intentional feature of
the <span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span> and <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> system.  It represents the
central design philosophy that all scoring functions should be modularly
composed of a small number of well-tested, reliable helper functions.  This
important feature minimizes the possibility of scoring errors and other
unexpected behaviors.  This starts with the <code>scoreScale</code>
function, and the benefits extend to the <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> functions and any
other scoring function that uses <code>scoreScale</code> as its backbone.
</p>
<p>Scoring procedures represent a major source of error in research studies
that rely upon PRO and similar measures.  These errors typically go
unnoticed, hidden, and/or ignored, eroding the scientific integrity of the
research and hindering progress in the numerous scientific fields that
conduct studies that use these measures.  A seemingly minor scoring error
can compromise measurement validity and reliability, as well as make
research results difficult to reproduce and unlikely to replicate. The
ultimate goal of the <span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span> and <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> packages is
to eliminate these serious deficiencies in PRO-based research by providing
a small set of gold-standard scoring tools for PRO-like measures commonly
used in research.
</p>


<h3>Overview of Functions</h3>

<p><strong>Main scoring workhorse:</strong>
</p>

<ul><li> <p><code>scoreScale</code>:  Scores a single scale score from a set
of items.  Has flexible arguments allowing almost any type of single
scale to be scored.  Can be used as the primary building block of more
complex scoring functions.  For example, if you are writing a new
function to score an instrument with 4 subscales, you can call
<code>scoreScale</code> 4 times from within your function, once for each
subscale.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Functions useful within another scoring function, or on their own:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>missTally</code>:  Count the number or proportion of items missing (or
non-missing) for each subject.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>rerange</code>:  Linearly rescale a variable to have new min and max values
of the user's choosing.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>rerange100</code>:  Like <code>rerange</code>, but the variable is rescaled
to range from 0 to 100.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>revcode</code>:  Reverse code the values of an item or score.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>makeItemNames</code>:  Easily make a vector of item names,
e.g., <code>c("Q1", "Q2", "Q3")</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>makeFakeData</code>:  Quick and dirty way to generate fake item data to test
scoring functions.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Functions mainly useful only within another scoring function:</strong>
</p>
<p>These functions are used to check the arguments supplied to custom-written
scoring functions, and to perform some minimal processing of function input.
<strong>AT THIS TIME, USE WITH CAUTION, IF AT ALL.</strong>  Most of these (if not
all) will likely undergo substantial changes in a near-future version of the
package, and/or be deprecated in favor of a more streamlined system (e.g.,
using the <span class="pkg">assertive</span> package).
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>msgWrap</code>:  Used inside of <code>paste</code> to help line-wrap long error
and warning messages.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>chk_nitems</code>:  Checks if a data frame has the correct number of items.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>chkstop_nitems</code>:  Checks if a data frame has the correct number of
items, and gives an error message if it does not.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>chk_values</code>:  Checks if all item values in a data frame are in the
expected set of possible values.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>chkstop_values</code>:  Checks if all item values in a data frame are in the
expected set of possible values, and gives an error message if this is
not true.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>get_dfItems</code>:  Given a data frame and an item index, returns a data
frame containing only the items.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>get_dfItemsrev</code>:  Like <code>get_dfItems</code>, but will also reverse code
some or all of the items.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Internal Functions Used by <code>scoreScale</code>
</h3>

<p>These are internal functions used to make the <code>scoreScale</code>
function more modular, and are used exclusively to check the arguments to
that function.  They will likely be of little use to others, and will
probably change in a near-future version of the package, or be deprecated
altogether in favor of a more streamlined system (e.g., using the
<span class="pkg">assertive</span> package).  They are documented here only for development
purposes.  <strong>NOTE</strong>: The interface and functionality of the
<code>scoreScale</code> function will remain stable, even if/when these
functions change.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>chkstop_df</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>chkstop_okmiss</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>chkstop_type</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>chkstop_revitems</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>chk_imin</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>chk_imax</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>chkstop_minmax</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
