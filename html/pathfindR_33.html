<h2>pathfindR: A package for Enrichment Analysis Utilizing Active Subnetworks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>pathfindR is a tool for active-subnetwork-oriented gene set enrichment analysis.
The main aim of the package is to identify active subnetworks in a
protein-protein interaction network using a user-provided list of genes
and associated p values then performing enrichment analyses on the identified
subnetworks, discovering enriched terms (i.e. pathways, gene ontology, TF target
gene sets etc.) that possibly underlie the phenotype of interest.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For analysis on non-Homo sapiens organisms, pathfindR offers utility functions
for obtaining organism-specific PIN data and organism-specific gene sets data.
</p>
<p>pathfindR also offers functionalities to cluster the enriched terms and
identify representative terms in each cluster, to score the enriched terms
per sample and to visualize analysis results.
