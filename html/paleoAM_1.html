<h2>Benthic Foram Abundances from the Gulf of Alaska Reported by Sharon et al 2021</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Loads the foraminifera abundances collected and published by Sharon et al. (2021),
as used in the simulation analyses published in Belanger and Bapst (2023).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data set is composed of three objects: 
</p>

<dl>
<dt>fullDataTable_GOA</dt>
<dd>
<p>The full data table containing sample IDs, DCA-1
scores and species abundances.</p>
</dd>
<dt>DCA1_GOA</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector of just the DCA-1 scores for each sample.</p>
</dd>
<dt>abundData_GOA</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of specimens identified as a particular
species for each sample.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This data set contains the absolute abundances (number of specimens identified)
for 48 species of benthic foraminifera, across 355 samples, taken from Sharon 
et al (2021). These samples were collected from the less than 63 micrometer size-fractions
taken from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 341 Site U141 and the 
co-located jumbo piston core, respectively located at 697 meters and 682 meters
water depth in the Gulf of Alaska (Jaeger et al., 2014).
