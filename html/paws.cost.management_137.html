<h2>Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must
integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the
RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the <code>register_usage</code> operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call <code>register_usage</code>, but you may choose to do so if you would like to receive usage data in your seller reports. The sections below explain the behavior of <code>register_usage</code>. <code>register_usage</code> performs two primary functions: metering and entitlement.
