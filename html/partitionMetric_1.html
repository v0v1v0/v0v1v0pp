<h2>Sample data for partitionMetric</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This small dataset contains aligned protein sequences for seven alleles of the
aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(AhRs)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The format is a character matrix in which column <code class="reqn">i</code> represents
the <code class="reqn">i</code>'th position in the alignment, and contains an amino
acid code or "-" indicating an indel.  Row names contain the
animal species. 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p> A DNA or protein sequence has an associated index set
<code class="reqn">\{1,2,\ldots,n\}</code> that labels the <code class="reqn">n</code>
positions of the nucleotides or amino acids (AA).
This index set can be partitioned such that all members referring to
the same AA share a homogeneous partition.
For example, given the sequence <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠ATGTA⁠</code> and its index
set <code class="reqn">\{1,2,\ldots,5\}</code>, the "A" partition
contains the subset <code class="reqn">\{1,5\}</code>, the "T" partition contains
<code class="reqn">\{2,4\}</code>, and so on.
</p>
<p>Given two aligned sequences and their respective partitions of the
index set, a metric distance between these partitions can be computed.  See
<code>partitionMetric</code> for such a metric, along with an example
of clustering this AhR dataset.  </p>
