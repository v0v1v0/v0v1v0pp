<h2>Spectral transmittance of plastic covers, climate screens and shade nets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A collection of transmittance spectra for plastic covers, climate screens and
shade nets used in horticulture. We include under "plastic covers, climate
screens and shade nets", nets, cloths and laminated and perforated films with
spatially heterogeneous optical properties. We exclude "filters" including
all semi-transparent and transparent sheets and films with spatially
homogeneous optical properties. Spectra for nearly 200 types of covers,
screens, and nets from eight suppliers were measured consistently as
described by Kotilainen et al. (2018).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">screens_nets.mspct
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>filter_mspct</code> object named <code>screens_nets.mspct</code> containing a
collection of <code>filter_spct</code> objects each with a variable number of
rows and 2 variables.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The variables for each spectrum are as follows:
</p>
 <ul>
<li>
<p> w.length (nm) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Tfr (fraction) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spectra were measured on new (never used) samples. Optical
properties can be expected to change with ageing due to chemical changes
induced by solar UV radiation and by soiling during the usual life
expectancy of five or more years. Spectral data for twenty four
climate-screen samples (ten Harmony-type, two Luxous-type, seven
Solaro-type and six Tempa-type) and four insect-screen samples provided by
Svensson (AB Ludvig Svensson, KINNA, Sweden,
<a href="https://www.ludvigsvensson.com/en/climate-screens">https://www.ludvigsvensson.com/en/climate-screens</a>). Twenty-six
shade-net samples (16 Sombra-type and ten Sombra raschel-type (patterned))
and 12 thrip, aphid, and insect -net samples (two Anti-Trip-type, eight
Anti-Afidos-type and two Anti-Insect types) were provided by Mallas
Textiles (Mallas Textiles Fabricantes, Chimalhuacán, Mexico,
<a href="https://mallastextilesmx.com/">https://mallastextilesmx.com/</a>) were described by Kotilainen et al.
(2018). Additional spectra obtained by the same authors are also included
in this package. If you use these data in publications, please, cite both
Kotilainen et al. (2018) and this package.
</p>
<p>The variables in each member spectrum are as follows: </p>
 <ul>
<li>
<p><code>w.length</code> (nm) </p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Tfr</code> (transmittance expressed as a
fraction of one) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> These member objects contain metadata stored as R
attributes. Accessors  to the metadata are available:
<code>what_measured()</code>, <code>how_measured()</code>, <code>when_measured()</code>,
<code>filter_properties()</code> and <code>comment()</code>.

<p>These data were acquired as part of research
funded by the Academy of Finland (Decision No. 304653 and 304519 to T. M.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Please see the help for the indexing vectors for specific details. The
original data of Kotilainen et al. (2018) plus additional spectral data are
available at Zenodo (Robson and Kotilainen, 2018). The data read from file
<code>ScreensNets_irrad_trans.xlsx</code>, worksheet <code>"database"</code>, have been
reprocessed to remove noise. The wavelength values have been "thinned" in
featureless regions using as criterion the lack of change in the local
slope to significantly reduce the size of the data set. Lossless
compression was applied to the R data file containing the data set.
