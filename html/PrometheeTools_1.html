<h2>Global and Local Searches for Net Flows to Sort</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function applies the GLNF Sorting (Global Local Net Flow Sorting)
algorithm to classify the alternatives into ordered groups according to the
decision-maker's preferences in multiple criteria context. GLNF sorting is
based on PROMETHEE net flows and a set of limiting profiles. This algorithm
starts from a global classification (global search) that is enhanced by two
local searches, intra-categorical and inter-categorical.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">GLNF(matrix_evaluation, data_criteria)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>matrix_evaluation</code></td>
<td>
<p>The matrix includes the values for all alternatives.
The alternatives and limiting profiles are row and columns correspond to
the evaluation criteria.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data_criteria</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix with the parameter information (rows) for each
criterion (columns). The rows of parameters are in the following order:
Function Type, Indifference Threshold, Preference Threshold, Objective and
Weight.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> The Limiting Profiles should be presented as rows in the matrix_evaluation.
The name must start with the letter "r" followed by the profile number
(e.g., "r1", "r2").
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For k categories, there should be k + 1 limiting profiles. To create k
groups the set of limit profiles are defined, where r1 is preferred to
r2,...,preferred to r(k+1).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The types of preference function are as follows: "linear", "v-shape",
"usual", "u-shape", "level" and "gaussian".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The preference and indifference thresholds depend on the type of function
selected. The preference threshold requires definition (is non-zero) for all
functions except for "usual" and "u-shaped". The indifference threshold is
non-zero for "linear", "level" and "u-shaped" functions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> In the objective write "max" to maximize or "min" to minimize.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The sum of the weights of all criteria must be equal to 1.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>-<code>Global</code> Matrix with the results of the global search where positive,
negative and net flow, and its preclassification are defined for each
alternative.
</p>
<p>-<code>Local1</code> Matrices with the results of the first local search. PROMETHEE is
applied to each group obtained in the global search. The alternatives are
divided according to their positive or negative sign from the net flows
obtained from PROMETHEE.
</p>
<p>-<code>Local2</code> Matrices with the results of the second local search, where the
alternatives are divided according to their sign from net flows are obtained
after applying PROMETHEE between each pair of neighbour categories.
</p>
<p>-<code>Class</code> Final classification of the alternatives results.
