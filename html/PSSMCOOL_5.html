<h2>AB-PSSM feature vector</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>to get This feature at first, each protein sequence is divided into
20 equal parts, each of which is called a block, and in each block the row vectors of the PSSM matrix related
to that block are added together and The resulting final vector is divided by the length of that block, which is
5
Finally, by placing these 20 vectors side by side, feature vector of length 400 is obtained.
</p>
