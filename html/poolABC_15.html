<h2>Perform D-statistics analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This functions calculates 3 different D-statistic values from pooled
sequenced data, using the allelic frequencies of the minor allele.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">D.statPool(pop_pi)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pop_pi</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a matrix of allele frequencies. Each row of that matrix
should correspond to a different population and each column to a different
SNP.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The three different combinations computed here are: D-statistic 1 sets the
the W ecotype in the first location (N2) as P1, the W ecotype in the second
location (N4) as P2 and the C ecotype at the first location (N1) as P3.
D-statistic 2 sets the W ecotype in the first location (N2) as P1, the C
ecotype in the second location (N3) as P2 and the C ecotype at the first
location (N1) as P3. D-statistic 3 sets the W ecotype at the first location
(N2) a P1, the C ecotype at the first location (N1) as P2 and the W ecotype
at the second location (N4) as P3.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a numeric vector with the three D-statistics values. Each
confirmation of the populations corresponds to a different entry of the
vector.
