<h2>Creates an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key, a logical
representation of a cryptographic key, that is unique in your account
and Amazon Web Services Region</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key, a logical representation of a cryptographic key, that is unique in your account and Amazon Web Services Region. You use keys for cryptographic functions such as encryption and decryption.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/paymentcryptographycontrolplane_create_key/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/paymentcryptographycontrolplane_create_key/</a> for full documentation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">paymentcryptographycontrolplane_create_key(
  KeyAttributes,
  KeyCheckValueAlgorithm = NULL,
  Exportable,
  Enabled = NULL,
  Tags = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>KeyAttributes</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The role of the key, the algorithm it supports, and the cryptographic
operations allowed with the key. This data is immutable after the key is
created.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>KeyCheckValueAlgorithm</code></td>
<td>
<p>The algorithm that Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses to
calculate the key check value (KCV). It is used to validate the key
integrity.
</p>
<p>For TDES keys, the KCV is computed by encrypting 8 bytes, each with
value of zero, with the key to be checked and retaining the 3 highest
order bytes of the encrypted result. For AES keys, the KCV is computed
using a CMAC algorithm where the input data is 16 bytes of zero and
retaining the 3 highest order bytes of the encrypted result.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Exportable</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] Specifies whether the key is exportable from the service.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Enabled</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies whether to enable the key. If the key is enabled, it is
activated for use within the service. If the key is not enabled, then it
is created but not activated. The default value is enabled.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Tags</code></td>
<td>
<p>Assigns one or more tags to the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
key. Use this parameter to tag a key when it is created. To tag an
existing Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key, use the
<code>tag_resource</code>
operation.
</p>
<p>Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and the
tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null) string.
You can't have more than one tag on an Amazon Web Services Payment
Cryptography key with the same tag key.
</p>
<p>Don't include personal, confidential or sensitive information in this
field. This field may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and
other output.
</p>
<p>Tagging or untagging an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key can
allow or deny permission to the key.</p>
