<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Disconnect a Recovery Instance from Elastic Disaster Recovery. Data replication is stopped immediately.

The following properties of the Recovery Instance will be changed immediately: dataReplicationInfo.dataReplicationState will be set to DISCONNECTED; The totalStorageBytes property for each of dataReplicationInfo.replicatedDisks will be set to zero; dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration and dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration will be nullified.
