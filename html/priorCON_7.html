<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Read connectivity data from multiple sub-folders.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">preprocess_graphs(path, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path</code></td>
<td>

<p>a path of the folder where sub-folders containing txt or csv files are
contained. Each sub-folder has the name of the corresponding connectivity data.
In case that a connectivity folder corresponds to a specific biodiversity
feature, it should be named as the corresponding feature.

<p>additional arguments passed to <code>read.csv</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is an auxiliary function for creating an edge list <code>data.frame</code>
object from multiple files, like the ones provided from softwares estimating
Lagrangian models.
</p>
<p>Function preprocess_graphs takes as input a list of .txt/.csv
objects. Each object represents the connections between a node and all the other
nodes. For the model to read the data, it is necessary to have all the .txt/.csv
objects in one folder. There are two ways to incorporate connectivity data,
based on their linkage to features:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Case 1: the connectivity data correspond to specific biodiversity
features. If a biodiversity feature has its own connectivity dataset then the
file including the edge lists needs to have the same name as the corresponding
feature. For example, consider having 5 species (f1, f2, f3, f4, f5) and 5
connectivity datasets. Then the connectivity datasets need to be in separate
folders named: f1,f2,f3,f4,f5 and the algorithm will understand that they
correspond to the species.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case 2: the connectivity dataset represents a spatial pattern that is not
directly connected with a specific biodiversity feature. Then the connectivity
data need to be included in a separate folder named in a different way than the
species. For example consider having 5 species (f1,f2,f3,f4,f5) and 1
connectivity dataset. This dataset can be included in a separate folder
(e.g. "Langragian_con").
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A typical Lagrangian output is a set of files representing the likelihood of a
point moving from an origin (source) to a destination (target). This can be
represented using a list of .txt/.csv files (as many as the origin points)
including information for the destination probability. The .txt/.csv files need
to be named in an increasing order. The name of the files need to correspond to
the numbering of the points, in order for the algorithm to match the coordinates
with the points.

</p>

<ul>
<li>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>to.X</code>: longitude of the destination (target).
</p>
</li>
<li>
