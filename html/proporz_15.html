</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

votes required for a seat. Then, each party receives the rounded down quota value as
seats. The remaining seats are given to the party with the largest remainder until all
seats have been distributed.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The number of seats per party as a vector
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Only the quota <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠total votes / total seats⁠</code> (which is used by the aforementioned
methods) is implemented.
