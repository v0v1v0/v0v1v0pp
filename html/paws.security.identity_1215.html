<h2>Creates a grouping of protected resources so they can be handled as a
collective</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a grouping of protected resources so they can be handled as a collective. This resource grouping improves the accuracy of detection and reduces false positives.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/shield_create_protection_group/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/shield_create_protection_group/</a> for full documentation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">shield_create_protection_group(
  ProtectionGroupId,
  Aggregation,
  Pattern,
  ResourceType = NULL,
  Members = NULL,
  Tags = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ProtectionGroupId</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The name of the protection group. You use this to identify the
protection group in lists and to manage the protection group, for
example to update, delete, or describe it.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Aggregation</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] Defines how Shield combines resource data for the group in order to
detect, mitigate, and report events.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Sum - Use the total traffic across the group. This is a good choice
for most cases. Examples include Elastic IP addresses for EC2
instances that scale manually or automatically.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Mean - Use the average of the traffic across the group. This is a
good choice for resources that share traffic uniformly. Examples
include accelerators and load balancers.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Max - Use the highest traffic from each resource. This is useful for
resources that don't share traffic and for resources that share that
traffic in a non-uniform way. Examples include Amazon CloudFront and
origin resources for CloudFront distributions.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Pattern</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The criteria to use to choose the protected resources for inclusion in
the group. You can include all resources that have protections, provide
a list of resource Amazon Resource Names (ARNs), or include all
resources of a specified resource type.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ResourceType</code></td>
<td>
<p>The resource type to include in the protection group. All protected
resources of this type are included in the protection group. Newly
protected resources of this type are automatically added to the group.
You must set this when you set <code>Pattern</code> to <code>BY_RESOURCE_TYPE</code> and you
must not set it for any other <code>Pattern</code> setting.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Members</code></td>
<td>
<p>The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resources to include in the
protection group. You must set this when you set <code>Pattern</code> to
<code>ARBITRARY</code> and you must not set it for any other <code>Pattern</code> setting.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Tags</code></td>
<td>
<p>One or more tag key-value pairs for the protection group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
