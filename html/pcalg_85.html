<h2>Reads off identifiable unconfounded node pairs from a directed PAG</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Constructs a matrix which contains identifiably unconfounded node pairs 
in the Markov equivalence class represented by a directed partial ancestral graph.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pag2conf(P)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>P</code></td>
<td>
<p>Adjacency matrix of type amat.pag, which should encode
a directed PAG (i.e., it should not contain any undirected edges of the
form <code>x --- y</code> or any circle-tail edges of the form <code>x o-- y</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>We say that nodes <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are confounded in a directed mixed graph (DMG) iff there
exists a bidirected edge <code>i&lt;-&gt;j</code> in that graph. If the directed mixed graph
has a causal interpretation (for example, if it is the graph of a simple SCM) then the presence
of a bidirected edge coincides (generically) with the presence of a confounder, i.e., a 
latent common cause (relative to the variables in the graph).
</p>
<p>This function implements the sufficient condition (Proposition 6) in Mooij and Claassen (2020) 
for concluding whether two nodes are unconfounded in all directed mixed graphs in the Markov 
equivalence class represented by the directed PAG <code>P</code>.
It applies to both the
acyclic case as well as the cyclic (simple SCM) case, assuming the d-separation resp. <code class="reqn">\sigma</code>-separation
Markov property.
</p>
<p>The output is a (symmetric) matrix containing for each ordered pair of nodes whether
the two nodes are identifiably unconfounded.
</p>
<p>It is not known whether these sufficient conditions for identifiability are complete. 
Hence, zero entries in the result indicate that the sufficient condition gives no 
conclusion, rather than that the Markov equivalence class represented by the directed PAG 
necessarily contains DMGs where a bidirected edge is present.
</p>
<p><code>P</code> should be an adjacency matrix of type amat.pag that contains no undirected
and circle-tail edges.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Matrix <code>A</code>, where entry <code>A[i,j]</code> equals </p>


<dl>
<dt>-1</dt>
<dd>
<p>if nodes <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are identifiably unconfounded,</p>
</dd>
<dt>0</dt>
<dd>
<p>in case it is unknown whether nodes <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are confounded or not.</p>
</dd>
