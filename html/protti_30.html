<h2>Fetch structure information from RCSB</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fetches structure metadata from RCSB. If you want to retrieve atom data such as positions, use
the function <code>fetch_pdb_structure()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fetch_pdb(pdb_ids, batchsize = 100, show_progress = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pdb_ids</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector of PDB identifiers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>batchsize</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric value that specifies the number of structures to be processed in a
single query. Default is 100.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>show_progress</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical value that indicates if a progress bar will be shown. Default is
TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame that contains structure metadata for the PDB IDs provided. The data frame
contains some columns that might not be self explanatory.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> auth_asym_id: Chain identifier provided by the author of the structure in order to
match the identification used in the publication that describes the structure.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> label_asym_id: Chain identifier following the standardised convention for mmCIF files.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> entity_beg_seq_id, ref_beg_seq_id, length, pdb_sequence: <code>entity_beg_seq_id</code> is a
position in the structure sequence (<code>pdb_sequence</code>) that matches the position given in
<code>ref_beg_seq_id</code>, which is a position within the protein sequence (not included in the
data frame). <code>length</code> identifies the stretch of sequence for which positions match
accordingly between structure and protein sequence. <code>entity_beg_seq_id</code> is a residue ID
based on the standardised convention for mmCIF files.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> auth_seq_id: Residue identifier provided by the author of the structure in order to
match the identification used in the publication that describes the structure. This character
vector has the same length as the <code>pdb_sequence</code> and each position is the identifier for
the matching amino acid position in <code>pdb_sequence</code>. The contained values are not
necessarily numbers and the values do not have to be positive.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> modified_monomer: Is composed of first the composition ID of the modification, followed
by the <code>label_seq_id</code> position. In parenthesis are the parent monomer identifiers as
they appear in the sequence.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ligand_*: Any column starting with the <code>ligand_*</code> prefix contains information about
the position, identity and donors for ligand binding sites. If there are multiple entities of
ligands they are separated by "|". Specific donor level information is separated by ";".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> secondar_structure: Contains information about helix and sheet secondary structure elements.
Individual regions are separated by ";".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> unmodeled_structure: Contains information about unmodeled or partially modeled regions in
the model. Individual regions are separated by ";".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> auth_seq_id_original: In some cases the sequence positions do not match the number of residues
in the sequence either because positions are missing or duplicated. This always coincides with modified
residues, however does not always occur when there is a modified residue in the sequence. This column
contains the original <code>auth_seq_id</code> information that does not have these positions corrected.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
