<h2>Partitioned Distances</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute distance matrix between two matrices of
observations, or two subsets of one matrix
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  pdist(X, Y = NULL, indices.A = NULL, indices.B = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix of n observations where columns
represent features of the observations</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Y</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional.  A second matrix of p observations
like X.  Y must have the same number of columns as X</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>indices.A</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional.  A vector of integers
representing row indices from X.  This should only be
used when Y is not provided.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>indices.B</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional.  A vector of integers
representing row indices from X.  This should only be
used when Y is not provided.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>pdist computes a n by p distance matrix using two
seperate matrices.  pdist allows the user to factor out
observations into seperate matrices to improve
computations.  The function dist computes the distances
between all possible pair wise elements, pdist only
computes the distance between observations in X with
observations in Y; distances between observations in X
and other observations in X are not computed, and
likewise for Y.
</p>
<p>If a second matrix Y is not provided, indices.A and
indices.B can be provided together to specify subsets of
X to be computed.  A new matrix X is created by taking
X[indices.A,] and Y is created using X[indices.B,].
</p>
<p>The return value of pdist is a distance vector, much like
the default return value for dist.  However, it can be
accessed like a full distance matrix.  If mypdist =
pdist(X,Y), mypdist[i,j] is the distance between X[i,]
and Y[j,].  Similarly, mypdist[i,] is a vector of
distances between X[i,] and all observations in Y.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">x = matrix(rnorm(100),10,10)
  x.pdist = pdist(x, indices.A = 1:3, indices.B = 8:10)
  message("Find the distance between observation 1 and 10 of x")
  x.pdist[1,3]
  message("Converting a pdist object into a traditional distance matrix")
  as.matrix(x.pdist)
</code></pre>
