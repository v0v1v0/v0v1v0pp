<h2>potato data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset potato is from an experiment on how plants adapt to
cold climates. The investigators decided to study this problem after
observing that plants that have been conditioned to cold previously
appear to suffer less damage from the cold. Two species of potato
were studied (species 1 and 2). Each plant was exposed to one of two
acclimatization regimes (1= plant was kept in cold room; 0= plant
was kept at room temperature) for several days. Later, plants were
subjected to one of two cold temperatures (-4 degrees C is coded as
1; -8 degrees C is coded as 2). Two responses were measured: damage
score for photosynthesis (photo), and damage score for ion leakage
(leak).

<dd>
<p> damage

</dd>
<dt>leak:</dt>
<dd>
<p>damage score for ion leakage</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Use ion leakage to be the response variable. Some of the 80 plants
originally assigned to the treatment combinations were lost during
the experiment. Analyze the data from the plants that made it
through, and assess the effects of the three experimental factors
species, regime, and temperature on the response leakage.
