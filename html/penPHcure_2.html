<h2>Criminal Recidivism Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A sample of 432 inmates released from Maryland state prisons followed for one year after release (Rossi et al. 1980).
The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the time to first arrest after release and some covariates observed during the follow-up period.
Most of the variables are constant over time, except one binary variable denoting whether the individual was working full time during the follow-up period.
