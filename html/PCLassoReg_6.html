<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function <code>PCLasso</code> implements the PCLasso model when the
parameter <code>penalty</code> is set to "grLasso". The PCLasso model is a
prognostic model which selects important predictors at the protein complex
level to achieve accurate prognosis and identify risk protein complexes.
The PCLasso model has three inputs: a gene expression matrix, survival
data, and protein complexes. It estimates the correlation between gene
expression in protein complexes and survival data at the level of protein
complexes. Similar to the traditional Lasso-Cox model, PCLasso is based on
the Cox PH model and estimates the Cox regression coefficients by
maximizing partial likelihood with regularization penalty. The difference
is that PCLasso selects features at the level of protein complexes rather
than individual genes. Considering that genes usually function by forming
protein complexes, PCLasso regards genes belonging to the same protein
complex as a group, and constructs a l1/l2 penalty based on the sum (i.e.,
l1 norm) of the l2 norms of the regression coefficients of the group
members to perform the selection of features at the group level. Since a
gene may belong to multiple protein complexes, that is, there is overlap
between protein complexes, the classical group Lasso-Cox model for
non-overlapping groups may lead to false sparse solutions. The PCLasso
model deals with the overlapping problem of protein complexes by
constructing a latent group Lasso-Cox model. And by reconstructing the gene
expression matrix of the protein complexes, the latent group Lasso-Cox
model is transformed into a non-overlapping group Lasso-Cox model in an
expanded space, which can be directly solved using the classical group
Lasso method. Through the final sparse solution, we can predict the
patient's risk score based on a small set of protein complexes and identify
risk protein complexes that are frequently selected to construct prognostic
models. The penalty parameters <code>grSCAD</code> and <code>grMCP</code> can also be
used to identify survival-related risk protein complexes. Their penalty for
large coefficients is smaller than <code>grLasso</code>, so they tend to choose
less risk protein complexes.
