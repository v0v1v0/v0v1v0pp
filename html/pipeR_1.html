<h2>The pipeR package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>pipeR implements various function chaining methods: <code>%&gt;&gt;%</code> operator,
<code>Pipe</code> object, and <code>pipeline</code> function. Each represents a distinct
pipeline model yet shares a common set of features designed to build
easy-to-read/write/maintain pipelines.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>pipeR package defines a set of syntax tailored for unified, intuitive piping
experience. The package is designed to help organize code as a streamline that
is consistent with logic and intuition.
</p>
<p>The following example shows how traditional code can be written in different
function chaining styles.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Traditional code:
plot(density(sample(mtcars$mpg, size = 10000, replace = TRUE),
 kernel = "gaussian"), col = "red", main="density of mpg (bootstrap)")

# Operator-based pipeline using %&gt;&gt;%:
mtcars$mpg %&gt;&gt;%
  sample(size = 10000, replace = TRUE) %&gt;&gt;%
  density(kernel = "gaussian") %&gt;&gt;%
  plot(col = "red", main = "density of mpg (bootstrap)")

# Object-based pipeline using Pipe():
Pipe(mtcars$mpg)$
  sample(size = 10000, replace = TRUE)$
  density(kernel = "gaussian")$
  plot(col = "red", main = "density of mpg (bootstrap)")

# Argument-based pipeline using pipeline():
pipeline(mtcars$mpg,
  sample(size = 10000, replace = TRUE),
  density(kernel = "gaussian"),
  plot(col = "red", main = "density of mpg (bootstrap)"))

# Expression-based pipeline using pipeline():
pipeline({
  mtcars$mpg
  sample(size = 10000, replace = TRUE)
  density(kernel = "gaussian")
  plot(col = "red", main = "density of mpg (bootstrap)")
})
