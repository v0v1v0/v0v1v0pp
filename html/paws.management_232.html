<h2>Deletes a specified stack</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Deletes a specified stack. Once the call completes successfully, stack deletion starts. Deleted stacks don't show up in the <code>describe_stacks</code> operation if the deletion has been completed successfully.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/cloudformation_delete_stack/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/cloudformation_delete_stack/</a> for full documentation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cloudformation_delete_stack(
  StackName,
  RetainResources = NULL,
  RoleARN = NULL,
  ClientRequestToken = NULL,
  DeletionMode = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>StackName</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The name or the unique stack ID that's associated with the stack.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>RetainResources</code></td>
<td>
<p>For stacks in the <code>DELETE_FAILED</code> state, a list of resource logical IDs
that are associated with the resources you want to retain. During
deletion, CloudFormation deletes the stack but doesn't delete the
retained resources.
</p>
<p>Retaining resources is useful when you can't delete a resource, such as
a non-empty S3 bucket, but you want to delete the stack.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>RoleARN</code></td>
<td>
<p>The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management
(IAM) role that CloudFormation assumes to delete the stack.
CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf.
</p>
<p>If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was
previously associated with the stack. If no role is available,
CloudFormation uses a temporary session that's generated from your user
credentials.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ClientRequestToken</code></td>
<td>
<p>A unique identifier for this
<code>delete_stack</code> request. Specify this
token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that
you're not attempting to delete a stack with the same name. You might
retry <code>delete_stack</code> requests to ensure
that CloudFormation successfully received them.
</p>
<p>All events initiated by a given stack operation are assigned the same
client request token, which you can use to track operations. For
example, if you execute a <code>create_stack</code>
operation with the token <code>token1</code>, then all the <code>StackEvents</code> generated
by that operation will have <code>ClientRequestToken</code> set as <code>token1</code>.
</p>
<p>In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the
Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the
token format <em>Console-StackOperation-ID</em>, which helps you easily
identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using
the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the
following format:
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002⁠</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>DeletionMode</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies the deletion mode for the stack. Possible values are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>STANDARD</code> - Use the standard behavior. Specifying this value is the
same as not specifying this parameter.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>FORCE_DELETE_STACK</code> - Delete the stack if it's stuck in a
<code>DELETE_FAILED</code> state due to resource deletion failure.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
