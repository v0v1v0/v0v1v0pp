<h2>Whittle Duplicate Conflict-Years by Conflict Reciprocation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>whittle_conflicts_reciprocation()</code> is in a class of
do-it-yourself functions for coercing (i.e. "whittling") conflict-year
data with cross-sectional units to unique conflict-year data by
cross-sectional unit. The inspiration here is clearly the problem
of whittling dyadic dispute-year data into true dyad-year data (like in
the Gibler-Miller-Little conflict data). This particular function will
keep the observations that are reciprocated (i.e. have militarized actions
on both sides of the conflict).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">whittle_conflicts_reciprocation(data)

wc_recip(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<p>a data frame with a declared conflict attribute type.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>

<p>optional, only to make the shortcut work</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Dyads are capable of having multiple disputes in a given year,
which can create a problem for merging into a complete dyad-year
data frame. Consider the case of France and Italy in 1860, which
had three separate dispute onsets that year (MID#0112, MID#0113, MID#0306),
as illustrative of the problem. The default process in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>
employs several rules to whittle down these duplicate dyad-years for
merging into a dyad-year data frame. These are available in
<code>add_cow_mids()</code> and <code>add_gml_mids()</code>.
</p>
<p>Scholars are free to use this as a heuristic for whittling conflict-year
data to be coerced into true dyad-year data, but I would be remiss if I
did not offer a caveat about the reciprocation variable in inter-state
dispute data. Namely, it is noisy and is not doing what scholars often
think it's doing in the inter-state dispute data. Reciprocation is observed
only when there is a militarized action on both sides of the conflict.
By definition, someone on Side A will have a militarized action. Not every
state on Side B does. However, scholars should <em>not</em> interpret that as
the absence of militarized responses. In a forthcoming article in
<em>Journal of Conflict Resolution</em>, Doug Gibler and I make the case that
reciprocation isn't a useful variable to maintain at all because it
can only invite errors (as is often the case in the CoW-MID data) and
will obscure the fact that states that are attacked by another side
routinely fight back. On many occasions, they also successfully repel
the attack. Scholars who uncritically use this variable, certainly for
hypothesis-testing on audience costs, are borrowing trouble with
this measure.
</p>
<p><code>wc_recip()</code> is a simple, less wordy, shortcut for the same function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>whittle_conflicts_reciprocation()</code> takes a dyad-year data
frame or leader-dyad-year data frame with a declared conflict attribute
type and, grouping by the dyad and year, returns just those observations
that have militarized actions on both sides of the conflict. This will not
eliminate all duplicates, far from it, but it's a sensible cut later into
the procedure (after whittling onsets in <code>whittle_conflicts_onsets()</code>
the extent to which dispute-level reciprocation is a heuristic for
dispute-level severity/importance (after some other considerations).
