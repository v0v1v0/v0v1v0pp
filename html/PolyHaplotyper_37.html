<h2>Read the haplotyping results from the ShesisPlus output</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Read the haplotyping results from the ShesisPlus output
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">read.ShesisPlus.output(SSPout, order.by=c("", "hapnr", "count")[2])
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SSPout</code></td>
<td>
<p>filename of a text file with ShesisPlus output (as copied from
the web page produced by running ShesisPlus web interface
at http://shesisplus.bio-x.cn/SHEsis.html); or a character vector with the
same output</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>order.by</code></td>
<td>
<p>how to order the rows of the hapstat data.frame. "hapnr" means
ordering by haplotype number, "count" means ordering by decreasing Total.count,
anything else results in no reordering. By default order by hapnr.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If present, the markernames and the haplotype statistics are read from
the file. ShesisPlus does not provide haplotype combinations for individuals
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list with 2 items: $markernames has the marker names in the markers in
the haploblock (if present in the file); hapstat contains the haplotype statistics
as read from the file with an additional (first) column hapnr: the haplotype
numbers as defined in PolyHaplotyper. The other columns are Haplotype (as sequences
of marker alleles), Total.count (of the haplotype over the whole population) and,
according to an email from Zhiqiang Li of 13-04-2020) BETA: Regression coefficient,
SE: Standard error, R2: Regression r-squared, T: t-distribution statistics,
P: p-value
</p>
