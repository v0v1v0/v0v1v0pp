<h3>Details</h3>

<p>FITBIR Definition for the "AgeYrs" data element: Value for participant's
subject age, calculated as elapsed time since the birth of the
participant/subject in years. The subjects age is typically recorded to the
nearest full year completed, e.g. 11 years and 6 months should be recorded as
11 years.
</p>
<p>Guidelines &amp; Instructions:
The subject's age is typically recorded to the nearest full year completed,
e.g. 11 years and 6 months should be recorded as 11 years. For subject's
which are under 1 year old, use decimal points and use the following
convention- record 1 month as 0.083 (1/12), 2 months as 0.166 (2/12), 3
months as 0.25 (3/12), 4 months as 0.333 (4/12), 5 months as 0.416 (5/12), 6
months as 0.5 (6/12), 7 months as 0.583 (7/12), 8 months as 0.666 (8/12), 9
months as 0.75 (9/12), 10 months as 0.833 (10/12), 11 months as 0.916 (11/12)
and 12 months as 1 year. For the individuals 90 or older, in order to
preserve PII, please submit "150" and make a note this in the "general notes"
column.
