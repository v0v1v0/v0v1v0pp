<h2>newspia</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function 'newspia' This function is based on SPIA algorithm to analyse KEGG signal pathway for single sample..
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">newspia(
  de = NULL,
  all = NULL,
  organism = "hsa",
  data.dir = NULL,
  pathids = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE,
  beta = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>de</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named vector containing the statue of particular genes in a particular sample.The names of this numeric vector are Entrez gene IDs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>all</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector with the Entrez IDs in the reference set. If the data was obtained from a microarray experiment,this set will contain all genes present on the specific array used for the experiment.This vector should contain all names of the de argument.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>organism</code></td>
<td>
<p>A three letter character designating the organism. See a full list at ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg/xml/organisms.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data.dir</code></td>
<td>
<p>Location of the "organism"SPIA.RData file containing the pathways data .If set to NULL will look for this file in the extdata folder of the PMAPscore library.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pathids</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector with the names of the pathways to be analyzed.If left NULL all pathways available will be tested.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>If set to TRUE, displays the number of pathways already analyzed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>beta</code></td>
<td>
<p>Weights to be assigned to each type of gene/protein relation type.
It should be a named numeric vector of length 23, whose names must be: c("activation","compound","binding/association","expression",
"inhibition","activation_phosphorylation","phosphorylation", "indirect","inhibition_phosphorylation","dephosphorylation_inhibition",
"dissociation","dephosphorylation","activation_dephosphorylation", "state","activation_indirect","inhibition_ubiquination","ubiquination",
"expression_indirect","indirect_inhibition","repression", "binding/association_phosphorylation","dissociation_phosphorylation","indirect_phosphorylation")
If set to null, beta will be by default chosen as: c(1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0).</p>
