<h2>Morphlogical Character and Range Data for late Ordovician and Early Silurian Graptoloidea</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains a morphological character matrix (containing both a set of
45 discrete characters, and 4 continuous characters coded as minimum and maximum
range values), along with biostratigraphic range data for 183 graptoloid
species-level taxa from Bapst et al. (2012, PNAS). Also includes a pre-calculated
distance matrix based on the character matrix, using the algorithm applied by Bapst
et al (2012). Interval dates for biostratigraphic zones is taken from Sadler et al. 2011.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This dataset is composed of three objects: 
</p>

<dl>
<dt>graptCharMatrix</dt>
<dd>
<p>A <code>matrix</code> composed of mixed character data
and a group code for 183 graptoloid taxa, with rows named with species
names and columns named with character names.</p>
</dd>
<dt>graptRanges</dt>
<dd>
<p>A <code>list</code> containing two matrices: the first matrix
describes the first and last interval times for 20 graptolite biozones
and the second matrix contains the first and last appearances of 183
graptolite species in those same biozones. (In other words, <code>graptRanges</code>
has the <code>timeList</code> format called by some <code>paleotree</code> functions).</p>
</dd>
<dt>graptDistMat</dt>
<dd>
<p>A 183x183 <code>matrix</code> of pair-wise distances (dissimilarities)
for the 183 graptolite species, using the algorithm for discrete characters
and min-max range values described in Bapst et al.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The character matrix contains characters of two differing types with a (very) small but
non-negligible amount of missing character data for some taxa. This required the
use of an unconventional ad hoc distance metric for the published analysis, resulting
in a (very slightly) non-Euclidean distance matrix. This breaks some assumptions of
some statistical analyses or requires special corrections, such as with PCO.
</p>
<p>Note that taxonomic data were collected only for species present within an interval
defined by the base of the Uncinatus biozone (~448.57 Ma) to the end of the cyphus
biozone (~439.37 Ma). Many taxa have first and last appearance dates listed in <code>graptRanges</code>
which are outside of this interval (see examples).
