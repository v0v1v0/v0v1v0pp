<h2>Standard game systems</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>game_systems</code> returns a list of <code>pp_cfg</code> objects
representing several game systems and pieces.
<code>to_subpack</code> and <code>to_hexpack</code> will attempt to generate matching (piecepack stackpack)
subpack and (piecepack) hexpack <code>pp_cfg</code> R6 objects respectively given a piecepack configuration.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">game_systems(style = NULL, round = FALSE, pawn = "token")

to_hexpack(cfg = getOption("piecepackr.cfg", pp_cfg()))

to_subpack(cfg = getOption("piecepackr.cfg", pp_cfg()))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>style</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>NULL</code> (the default) uses suit glyphs from the default “sans” font.
If <code>"dejavu"</code> it will use suit glyphs from the "DejaVu Sans" font
(must be installed on the system).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>round</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code> the “shape” of “tiles” and “cards”
will be “roundrect” instead of “rect” (the default).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pawn</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>"token"</code> (default) the piecepack pawn will be a two-sided token in a “halma” outline,
if <code>"peg-doll"</code> the piecepack pawn will be a “peg doll” style pawn, and
if <code>"joystick"</code> the piecepack pawn will be a “joystick” style pawn.
Note for the latter two pawn styles only <code>pawn_top</code> will work with <code>grid.piece</code>.</p>
