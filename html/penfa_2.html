<h2>Data set for cross-cultural analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set for cross-cultural analysis containing the
standardized ratings to 12 items concerning organizational citizenship
behavior. Employees from different countries were asked to rate their
attitudes towards helping other employees and giving suggestions for
improved work conditions. The items are thought to measure two latent
factors: helping behavior (first seven items) and voice behavior
(last five items). See below for details.
