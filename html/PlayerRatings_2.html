<h2>The Elo Rating System</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements the Elo rating system for estimating the relative 
skill level of players in two-player games such as chess. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">elo(x, status = NULL, init = 2200, gamma = 0, kfac = 27, 
    history = FALSE, sort = TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing four variables: (1) a numeric
vector denoting the time period in which the game took place
(2) a numeric or character identifier for player one (3)
a numeric or character identifier for player two and (4)
the result of the game expressed as a number, typically
equal to one for a player one win, zero for a player two
win and one half for a draw.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>status</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame with the current status of the
system. If not <code>NULL</code>, this needs to be a data frame 
in the form of the <code>ratings</code> component of the returned 
list, containing variables named <code>Player</code>, <code>Rating</code>,
and optionally <code>Games</code>, <code>Win</code>, <code>Draw</code>, 
<code>Loss</code> and <code>Lag</code>, which are set to zero if not given.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>init</code></td>
<td>
<p>The rating at which to initialize a new player not
appearing in <code>status</code>. Must be a single number. If
different initializations for different players are required,
this can be done using <code>status</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gamma</code></td>
<td>
<p>A player one advantage parameter; either a single
value or a numeric vector equal to the number of rows in 
<code>x</code>. Positive values favour player one, while negative 
values favour player two. This could represent the advantage 
of playing at home, or the advantage of playing white for chess. 
Note that this is not passed to <code>predict.rating</code>, 
which has its own <code>gamma</code> parameter.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>kfac</code></td>
<td>
<p>The K factor parameter. Can be a single number or
a vectorized function of two arguments, the first being the
ratings and the second being the number of games played. See
<code>kfide</code>, <code>kgames</code>  and
<code>krating</code> for examples.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>history</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code> returns the entire history for each 
period in the component <code>history</code> of the returned list.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sort</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code> sort the results by rating (highest
to lowest). If <code>FALSE</code> sort the results by player.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Passed to the function <code>kfac</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Elo rating system is a simple method for evaluating the skill 
of players. It has been used since around 1960 and is still
employed in various settings. Although the basic form uses only 
the ratings, additional complexity is commonly introduced
by adding a player one advantage parameter and by using different
K factors. A player one advantage parameter has been added to the 
original definition in the reference. A player one advantage 
parameter is also used for prediction purposes in 
<code>predict.rating</code>.
</p>
<p>This implementation has a simple initialization, and allows the 
K factor to depend on both the ratings and the number of games 
played. Default values are roughly optimized the chess data 
analyzed in the file doc/ChessRatings.pdf, using the binomial 
deviance criterion and considering only constant K factors. 
See the function <code>fide</code> for a different 
implementation.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list object of class <code>"rating"</code> with the following 
components
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ratings</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame of the results at the end of the 
final time period. The variables are self explanatory except
for <code>Lag</code>, which represents the number of time periods
since the player last played a game. This is equal to zero
for players who played in the latest time period, and is
also zero for players who have not yet played any games.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>history</code></td>
<td>
<p>A three dimensional array, or <code>NULL</code> if 
<code>history</code> is <code>FALSE</code>. The row dimension is the 
players, the column dimension is the time periods. 
The third dimension gives different parameters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gamma</code></td>
<td>
<p>The player one advantage parameter.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>kfac</code></td>
<td>
<p>The K factor or K factor function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>The character string <code>"Elo"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
