<h2>Whittle Duplicate Conflict-Years by Conflict Duration</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>whittle_conflicts_duration()</code> is in a class of
do-it-yourself functions for coercing (i.e. "whittling") conflict-year
data with cross-sectional units to unique conflict-year data by
cross-sectional unit. The inspiration here is clearly the problem
of whittling dyadic dispute-year data into true dyad-year data (like in
the Gibler-Miller-Little conflict data). This particular function will
keep the observations with the highest estimated duration.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">whittle_conflicts_duration(data, durtype = "mindur")

wc_duration(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with a declared conflict attribute type.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>durtype</code></td>
<td>
<p>a duration on which to filter/whittle the data. Options include <code>"mindur"</code> or  <code>"maxdur"</code>. The default is  <code>"mindur"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, only to make the shortcut work</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Dyads are capable of having multiple disputes in a given year,
which can create a problem for merging into a complete dyad-year
data frame. Consider the case of France and Italy in 1860, which
had three separate dispute onsets that year (MID#0112, MID#0113, MID#0306),
as illustrative of the problem. The default process in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>
employs several rules to whittle down these duplicate dyad-years for
merging into a dyad-year data frame. These are available in
<code>add_cow_mids()</code> and <code>add_gml_mids()</code>.
</p>
<p>Some conflicts can be of an unknown length and often come with estimates
of a minimum duration and a maximum duration. This will concern the
<code>durtype</code> parameter in this function. In many/most conflicts,
certainly thinking of the inter-state dispute data, dates are known with
precision (to the day) and the estimate of minimum conflict duration is
equal to the estimate of maximum conflict duration. For some conflicts,
the estimates will vary. This does importantly imply that using this
particular whittle function with the default (<code>mindur</code>) will produce
different results than using this particular whittle function and asking
to retain the highest maximum duration (<code>maxdur</code>). Use the function
with that in mind.
</p>
<p><code>wc_duration()</code> is a simple, less wordy, shortcut for the same function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>whittle_conflicts_duration()</code> takes a dyad-year data frame
or leader-dyad-year data frame  with a declared conflict attribute type
and, grouping by the dyad and year, returns just those observations that
have the highest observed dispute-level fatality. This will not eliminate
all duplicates, far from it, but it's a sensible cut later into the
procedure (after whittling onsets in <code>whittle_conflicts_onsets(),
and maybe some other things</code> the extent to which dispute-level duration
is a heuristic for dispute-level severity/importance.
