<h2>Rat Blood Pressure</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Twelve rats were chosen, and a drug was administered to six rats, the treatment group, chosen at random. The other six rats, the control group, received a placebo. The drops in blood pressure (mmHg) for the treatment group (with probability distribution F) and the control group (with probability distribution G), respectively, were recorded.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">RATBP
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 12 observations on the following 2 variables: 
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>mmHg</code> (drops in blood pressure in mm of Hg where positive values are decreases, negative values are increases)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>group</code> (factor with levels <code>control</code> and <code>treatment</code>)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The data is originally from Ott and Mendenhall (<em>Understanding Statistics</em>, 1985, problem 8.17).
