<h2>Problems in Elementary Probability Theory</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set contains responses to problems in elementary probability
theory observed before and after some instructions (the so-called learning
object) were given.  Data were collected both in the lab and via an online
questionnaire.  Of the 1127 participants eligible in the online study, 649
were excluded because they did not complete the first set of problems
(p101, ..., p112) or they responded too quickly or too slowly.  Based on
similar criteria, further participants were excluded for the second set of
problems, indicated by missing values in the variables b201, ..., b212.
Problems were presented in random order.
</p>
<p>Participants were randomized to two conditions: an enhanced learning object
including instructions with examples and a basic learning object without
examples.  Instructions were given on four concepts: how to calculate the
classic probability of an event (pb), the probability of the complement of
an event (cp), of the union of two disjoint events (un), and of two
independent events (id).
</p>
<p>The questionnaire was organized as follows:
