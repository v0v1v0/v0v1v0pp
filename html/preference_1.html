<h2>Design and Analysis of Two-stage Randomized Clinical Trials</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">preference</span> package is used for the design and 
analysis of two-stage randomized trials with a continuous outcome 
measure. In this study, patients are first randomized to either a 
random or choice arm. Patients 
initially randomized to the choice arm are allowed to select their preferred
treatment from the available treatment options; patients initially randomized
to the random arm undergo a second randomization procedure to one of the 
available treatment options. The design has also been extended to include
important stratification variables; the functions provided in this package
can accommodate both the unstratified and stratified designs.
</p>
<p>In this study, there are three effects that may be of interest. The treatment
effect captures the difference in outcome between patients randomized to 
treatment A and treatment B (similar to a traditional RCT). The selection 
effect captures the difference in outcome between patients that prefer 
treatment A and patients that prefer treatment B, regardless of the 
treatment that is actually received. Finally, the preference effect compares
the outcomes of patients who receive their preferred treatment (either 
treatment A or treatment B) and patients who do not receive their preferred
treatment. 
</p>
<p>To aid in the design of these two-stage randomized studies, sample size 
functions are provided to determine the necessary sample size to 
detect a particular selection, preference, and/or treatment effect. If the 
sample size is fixed prior to the start of the study, functions are provided
to calculate the study power to detect each effect. Finally, the 
<code>optimal_proportion</code> function can be used to determine the optimal 
proportion of patients randomized to the choice arm in the initial 
randomization. 
</p>
<p>To analyze the data from the two-stage randomized trial, two analysis
functions are provided. The function <code>preference</code> computes the 
test statistic and p-value for each effect given provided raw study data. 
The function <code>fit_preference_summary</code> uses provided summary data (mean, 
variance, and sample size) of each study group to compute the test statistic
and p-value of each effect. The test statistics can be accessed from
the models using the <code>summary()</code> function.
