<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The responses include a legislative_day attribute which is the earliest the bills could be considered,
and a range attribute that indicates whether the bill information comes from a weekly schedule or a daily one.
Combine the two for the best sense of when a bill might come up for consideration. For Senate bills,
the response includes a context attribute reproducing the sentence that includes mention of the bill.
These responses omit bills that have not yet been assigned a bill number or introduced, and additional bills
may be considered at any time.
