<h2>Returns a set of temporary credentials for an Amazon Web Services
account or IAM user</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns a set of temporary credentials for an Amazon Web Services account or IAM user. The credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use <code>get_session_token</code> if you want to use MFA to protect programmatic calls to specific Amazon Web Services API operations like Amazon EC2 <code>StopInstances</code>.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/sts_get_session_token/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/sts_get_session_token/</a> for full documentation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sts_get_session_token(
  DurationSeconds = NULL,
  SerialNumber = NULL,
  TokenCode = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>DurationSeconds</code></td>
<td>
<p>The duration, in seconds, that the credentials should remain valid.
Acceptable durations for IAM user sessions range from 900 seconds (15
minutes) to 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with 43,200 seconds (12 hours)
as the default. Sessions for Amazon Web Services account owners are
restricted to a maximum of 3,600 seconds (one hour). If the duration is
longer than one hour, the session for Amazon Web Services account owners
defaults to one hour.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SerialNumber</code></td>
<td>
<p>The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the
IAM user who is making the <code>get_session_token</code>
call. Specify this value if the IAM user has a policy that requires MFA
authentication. The value is either the serial number for a hardware
device (such as <code>GAHT12345678</code>) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
virtual device (such as <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user⁠</code>). You can
find the device for an IAM user by going to the Amazon Web Services
Management Console and viewing the user's security credentials.
</p>
<p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
characters: =,.@:/-</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>TokenCode</code></td>
<td>
<p>The value provided by the MFA device, if MFA is required. If any policy
requires the IAM user to submit an MFA code, specify this value. If MFA
authentication is required, the user must provide a code when requesting
a set of temporary security credentials. A user who fails to provide the
code receives an "access denied" response when requesting resources that
require MFA authentication.
</p>
<p>The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a
sequence of six numeric digits.</p>
