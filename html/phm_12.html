<h3>Details</h3>

to a term-frequency matrix. The function freqPhrases displays the most 
frequent principal phrases in a phraseDoc object. The function getDocs will
create a frequency matrix with all documents/texts that contain certain 
phrases, while getPhrases will create a frequency matrix with all phrases
present in a specific collection of documents/texts.
