<h2>Creates an IAM role that is linked to a specific Amazon Web Services
service</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates an IAM role that is linked to a specific Amazon Web Services service. The service controls the attached policies and when the role can be deleted. This helps ensure that the service is not broken by an unexpectedly changed or deleted role, which could put your Amazon Web Services resources into an unknown state. Allowing the service to control the role helps improve service stability and proper cleanup when a service and its role are no longer needed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create-service-linked-role.html">Using service-linked roles</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">iam_create_service_linked_role(
  AWSServiceName,
  Description = NULL,
  CustomSuffix = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>AWSServiceName</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The service principal for the Amazon Web Services service to which this
role is attached. You use a string similar to a URL but without the
http:// in front. For example: <code>elasticbeanstalk.amazonaws.com</code>.
</p>
<p>Service principals are unique and case-sensitive. To find the exact
service principal for your service-linked role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">Amazon Web Services services that work with IAM</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>. Look for the services that have <strong>Yes</strong> in the
<strong>Service-Linked Role</strong> column. Choose the <strong>Yes</strong> link to view the
service-linked role documentation for that service.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Description</code></td>
<td>
<p>The description of the role.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>CustomSuffix</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string that you provide, which is combined with the service-provided
prefix to form the complete role name. If you make multiple requests for
the same service, then you must supply a different <code>CustomSuffix</code> for
each request. Otherwise the request fails with a duplicate role name
error. For example, you could add <code>-1</code> or <code>-debug</code> to the suffix.
</p>
<p>Some services do not support the <code>CustomSuffix</code> parameter. If you
provide an optional suffix and the operation fails, try the operation
again without the suffix.</p>
