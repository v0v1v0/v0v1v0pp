<h2>Simulated data for a simultaneous equation system</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>SURdata</code> dataset consists of an unbalanced panel comprising 100 individuals observed across four time periods for a total of 220 observations (n=100, T=4, N=220). In order to construct this unbalanced panel, the procedure currently used for rotating panels, in which there is approximately the same number of individuals every year, has been used: a fixed percentage of individuals (20% in this case) is replaced each year, but they can re-enter the sample in the following years.
