<h2>Package 'packagefinder'</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Comfortable search for R packages on CRAN directly from the R console
</p>


<h3>What is packagefinder? How does it benefit me?</h3>

<p>Currently, there are more than 16,000 R package contributions on CRAN providing R with an unparalleled wealth of features. The downside of the large and increasing amount of packages is that it becomes increasingly difficult to find the right tools to tackle a specific problem. Unfortunately, CRAN does not provide any good search functionality.
</p>
<p><strong>packagefinder</strong> is designed to search for CRAN packages right from the R console. The philosophy behind this package is that R users like using the R console and need a tool to do their day-to-day-work on CRAN without leaving their normal workspace, the console. In fact, the idea is that with <strong>packagefinder</strong> you do not <em>need</em> to leave the R console to work with CRAN effectively.
</p>
<p><strong>packagefinder</strong> is developed to save you time and energy finding the right packages to work with, thereby making your work with R more productive.
