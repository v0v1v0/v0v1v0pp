<h2>Score the EORTC QLQ-BLM30 Quality of Life Questionnaire</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Scores the European Organization for Research and Treatment of
Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-BLM30 Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer Module.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">qlq_blm30(df, items = NULL, keepNvalid = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing responses to the 30 QLQ-BLM30 items, and
possibly other variables.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>items</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector with the QLQ-BLM30 item names, or a numeric
vector indicating the column numbers of the QLQ-BLM30 items in <code>df</code>.
If <code>items</code> is omitted, then <code>qlq_blm30</code> will assume that
<code>df</code> contains <strong>ONLY</strong> the QLQ-BLM30 items and no other variables.
See Details for more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keepNvalid</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical, whether to return variables containing the
number of valid, non-missing items on each scale for each respondent should
be returned in the data frame with the scale scores.  The default is
<code>FALSE</code>.  Set to <code>TRUE</code> to return these variables, which will be
named <code>"scalename_N"</code> (e.g., <code>QL_N</code>).  Most users should omit
this argument entirely.  This argument might be removed from future
versions of the package, so please let me know if you think this argument
useful and would rather it remain a part of the function.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function returns a total of 7 different scores from the EORTC
QLQ-BLM30. Scores are calculated according to the official scoring algorithms
from the EORTC.
</p>
<p>In addition to the name of your data frame containing the QLQ-BLM30 item
responses (<code>df</code>), you need to tell the function how to find the
variables that correspond to the QLQ-BLM30 items in <code>df</code>.  You can do this
in 1 of 2 ways:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> The first way is to manually provide the item names or locations
using the <code>items</code> argument.  For example, if your first 10
variables in <code>df</code> contain demographics, followed by the 30 QLQ-BLM30
items <strong>in order</strong> starting with the 11th variable, then you could
use <code>items = 11:40</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The second way only applies if your data frame (<code>df</code>) contains
<strong>ONLY</strong> the 30 variables corresponding to the 30 QLQ-BLM30 items,
in order, with no other non-QLQ-BLM30 variables.  In this case, you can
just use the <code>df</code> argument and omit <code>items</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with all 7 of the QLQ-BLM30 scores is returned.  Of the 7
scores, there are 5 multi-item Symptom Scales, 1 single-item Symptom Scale
(Catheter Use Problems), and 1 multi-item Functional Scale (Sexual
Functioning) (see below).  All scores are scaled to range from 0-100, even
scores based on single items.  Be aware that these single-item scales still
have only 4 possible values, even though they are transformed to range from
0-100.  The scale names and numbers of items are listed below.
</p>
<p><strong>Symptom Scales (higher is more symptoms, worse functioning)</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>BLM_US</strong> - Urinary Symptoms (from 7 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>BLM_UP</strong> - Urostomy Problems (from 6 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>BLM_FU</strong> - Future Perspective (from 3 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>BLM_BAF</strong> - Abdominal Bloating and Flatulence (from 2 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>BLM_BI</strong> - Body Image (from 3 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>BLM_CU</strong> - Catheter Use Problems (from 1 item)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Functional Scales (higher is better functioning)</strong>
</p>

<ul><li> <p><strong>BLM_SX</strong> - Sexual Functioning (from 2, 4, 6, or 7 items,
depending on the respondent)
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Optionally, the data frame can additionally have variables containing the
number of valid item responses on each scale for each respondent (if
<code>keepNvalid = TRUE</code>, but this option might be removed in future package
updates).
</p>


<h3>How Missing Data is Handled</h3>

<p>For all scale scores <strong>except for the Sexual Functioning scale</strong>, the
<code>qlq_blm30</code> function will calculate the scale scores as long as at
least half of the items on the given scale have valid, non-missing item
responses.  Scores calculated in the presence of missing items are
pro-rated so that their theoretical minimum and maximum values are
identical to those from scores calculated from complete data.
</p>
<p>The Sexual Functioning scale is handled differently because it has several
conditional questions that may not be applicable to a given patient (i.e.,
some questions apply only to men or only to women, and some questions apply
only to sexually active respondents).  As a result, the Sexual Functioning
scale may have 2, 4, 6, or 7 questions applicable for a given respondent.
Because the minimum number of applicable items is 2, the <code>qlq_blm30</code>
function will calculate the  Sexual Functioning scale score as long as at
least 1 of the items has a valid, non-missing response.  Note that this can
result in the <code>qlq_blm30</code> function scoring the Sexual Functioning
scale for some respondents when they should technically be assigned a
missing value for the scale.
