<h2>Add an objective</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An objective is used to specify the overall goal of a conservation planning
problem. All conservation planning problems involve minimizing
or maximizing some kind of objective. For instance, the planner may require
a solution that conserves enough habitat for each species while minimizing
the overall cost of the reserve network. Alternatively, the planner may
require a solution that maximizes the number of conserved species while
ensuring that the cost of the reserve network does not exceed the budget.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Please note that all conservation
planning problems formulated using the <span class="pkg">prioritizr</span> package require an
objective function, and attempting to solve a problem without an objective
will result in an error.</strong>
</p>
<p>The following objectives can be added to a conservation planning
<code>problem()</code>:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>add_min_set_objective()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Minimize the cost of the
solution whilst ensuring that all targets are met. This objective is
similar to that used in <em>Marxan</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_max_cover_objective()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Represent at least one
instance of as many features as possible within a given budget.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_max_features_objective()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Fulfill as many targets as
possible while ensuring that the cost of the solution does not exceed a
budget.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_min_shortfall_objective()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Minimize the overall
(weighted sum) shortfall for as many targets as possible while ensuring
that the cost of the solution does not exceed a budget.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_min_largest_shortfall_objective()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Minimize the
largest (maximum) shortfall among all targets while ensuring that
the cost of the solution does not exceed a budget.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_max_phylo_div_objective()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Maximize the phylogenetic
diversity of the features represented in the solution subject to a
budget.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_max_phylo_end_objective()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Maximize the phylogenetic
endemism of the features represented in the solution subject to a
budget.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_max_utility_objective()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Secure as much of the
features as possible without exceeding a budget.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
