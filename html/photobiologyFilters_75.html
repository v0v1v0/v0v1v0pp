<h2>Spectral transmittance for filter stacks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Indexing vector for selecting transmittance spectra for stacks
of two or more filters.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">stacked_filters
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A vector of character strings.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A character vector of names of spectra in object <code>filter.mspct</code>
measured by P. J. Aphalo from stacks of filters. Unless differently
indicated in the spectrum metadata, the filters in the stack were separated
by an air gap. Because of multiple reflections at the air-glass interfaces
the measured spectra differ slightly from the result of a simple
convolution between the spectra corresponding to the individual filters.
