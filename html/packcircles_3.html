<h2>Find an arrangement of circles satisfying a graph of adjacencies</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Attempts to derive an arrangement of circles satisfying prior conditions for 
size and adjacency. Unlike the <code>circleRepelLayout</code> function, this
is a deterministic algorithm. Circles are classified as either internal or 
external. Viewing the pattern of adjacencies as a triangulated mesh, external
circles are those on the boundary. In the version of the algorithm 
implemented here, the radii of external circles are provided as inputs, while
the radii of internal circles are derived as part of the output arrangement.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">circleGraphLayout(internal, external)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>internal</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of vectors of circle ID values where, in each vector,
the first element is the ID of an internal circle and the remaining
elements are the IDs of that circle's neighbours arranged as a cycle. The
cycle may be clockwise or anti-clockwise but the same ordering must be used
for all vectors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>external</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data.frame or matrix of external circle radii, with circle
IDs in the first column and radii in the second column.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>internal</code> argument specifies circle adjacencies (ie. tangencies). 
The format is an concise representation of graph edges, and consists of a 
list of vectors: one per internal circle. In each vector the first element is
the ID value of the internal circle and the remaining values are IDs of 
neighbouring circles, which may be either internal or external.
</p>
<p>The <code>external</code> argument is a data.frame which specifies the radii of 
external circles. Internal circle radii should not be specified as they are 
derived as part of the fitting algorithm. The function will issue an error if
any internal circle IDs are present in the <code>external</code> data.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.frame with columns for circle ID, centre X and Y ordinate, and
radius.
</p>
<p>The output arrangement as a data.frame with columns for circle ID,
centre X and Y ordinates, and radius. For external circles the radius will
equal input values.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Please treat this function as experimental.
