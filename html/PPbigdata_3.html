Factor rotation for projected Big Data in multi-dimensional space based on data nuggets
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function performs the factor rotation for projected big data in multi-dimensional space based on data nuggets.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">faProj(nugg, weight, wsph_proj = NULL, proj, method = c("varimax","promax"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nugg</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data nugget centers obtained from raw data. Must be a data matrix (of class matrix, or data.frame) with at least two columns.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weight</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of the weight parameter for each data nugget. Its length should be the same as the number of data nuggets, i.e., nrow(nugg). Must be of class numeric or integer.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>wsph_proj</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix of size ncol(nugg) by ncol(nugg). It's the sphering/whitening matrix considering nugget weights for the transformation. The projection is on the spherized data nugget centers considering weights, which is obtained by multiplying the centered data nuggets with weights by this sphering/whitening matrix. Default is NULL, which would be obtained by function <code>wsph</code>. Must be a data matrix containing only entries of class numeric.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>proj</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix of size ncol(nugg) by projection dimenstion. It's the orthonormal projection matrix that would be taken on the spherized data nugget centers considering weights, to obtain projected data nuggets. Must be a data matrix containing only entries of class numeric.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character indicating the rotation method used for factor analysis. The default method "<code>varimax</code>" uses function <code>varimax</code> to take rotation; the alternative "<code>promax</code>" uses function <code>promax</code>. The rotation is taken on the overall transformation matrix for the raw data nuggets, which is a combination of spherization matrix and projection matrix, to back to the original variables.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function performs the factor rotation for projected big data in multi-dimensional space based on data nuggets.
</p>
<p>Data nuggets are a representative sample meant to summarize Big Data by reducing a large dataset to a much smaller dataset by eliminating redundant points while also preserving the peripheries of the dataset. Each data nugget is defined by a center (location), weight (importance), and scale (internal variability). Data nuggets for a large dataset could be created and refined by functions <code>create.DN</code> or <code>refine.DN</code> in the package <code>datanugget</code>.
</p>
<p>After obtaining created and refined data nuggets for big data, data nugget centers needs to be spherized considering nugget weights before conducting projection pursuit. The optimal or interested projection found by projection pursuit would be taken on the spherized nugget centers. This function conducts the factor analysis for the projected data nugget centers.  The default rotation method "<code>varimax</code>" uses function <code>varimax</code> to take rotation; the alternative "<code>promax</code>" uses function <code>promax</code>. The rotation is taken on the overall transformation matrix for the raw data nuggets, which is a combination of spherization matrix and projection matrix, to back to the original variables.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing the following components:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nuggproj_rotat</code></td>
<td>
<p>The rotated projected data nugget centers after conducting factor ratation. It's obtained by multiplying the centered data nuggets <code>nugg_wcen</code> with the rotated matrix <code>loadings</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>loadings</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix of loadings for original variables, one column for each projection direction. It's the rotated transformation matrix to obtain updated projected data nugget centers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nugg_wcen</code></td>
<td>
<p>The centered data nugget centers that has a zero weighted mean for each column considering nugget weights. It's obtained by extracting the weighted mean from the original data nugget centers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
