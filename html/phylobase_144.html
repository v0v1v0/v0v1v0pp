<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Base package for phylogenetic structures and comparative data.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>phylobase</code> provides a set of functions to associate and
manipulate phylogenetic information and data about the
species/individuals that are in the tree.
</p>
<p><code>phylobase</code> intends to be robust, fast and efficient. We hope
other people use the data structure it provides to develop new
comparative methods in R.
</p>
<p>With <code>phylobase</code> it is easy to ensure that all your data are
represented and associated with the tips or the internal nodes of
your tree. <code>phylobase</code> provides functions to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> prune (subset) your trees, find ancestor(s) a
descendant(s)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> find the most common recent ancestor of 2 nodes (MRCA)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> calculate the distance of a given node from the tip or
between two nodes in your tree
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> robust functions to import data from NEXUS and Newick files
using the NEXUS Class Library (<a href="https://github.com/mtholder/ncl/">https://github.com/mtholder/ncl/</a>)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>History</h3>

<p><code>phylobase</code> was started during a Hackathlon at NESCent on
December 10-14 2007.
</p>
<p>Peter Cowan was a Google Summer of Code fellow in 2008 and
developed all the code for plotting.
</p>
<p>In December 2008, a mini-virtual Hackathlon was organized to clean
up and make the code more robust.
</p>
<p>In the spring and summer of 2009, Jim Regetz made several
contributions that made the code faster (in particular with the
re-ordering parts), found many bugs, and wrote most of the testing
code.
</p>
<p><code>phylobase</code> was first released on CRAN on November 1st, 2009
with version 0.5.
</p>
<p>Since then, several releases have followed adding new
functionalities: better support of NEXUS files, creation of
<code>phylobase.options()</code> function that controls the <code>phylo4</code>
validator, rewrite of the validator in C++.
</p>
<p>Starting with 0.6.8, Francois Michonneau succeeds to Ben Bolker as
the maintainer of the package.
