<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Riefer, Knapp, Batchelder, Bamber and Manifold (2002) report a study on
memory deficits in schizophrenic (n = 29) and organic alcoholic (n = 21)
patients who were compared to two matched control groups (n = 25, n = 21).
Participants were presented with 20 pairs of semantically related words. In
a later memory test, they freely recalled the presented words. This
procedure was repeated for a total of six study and test trials. Responses
were classified into four categories: both words in a pair are recalled
adjacently (E1) or non-adjacently (E2), one word in a pair is recalled (E3),
neither word in a pair is recalled (E4).
