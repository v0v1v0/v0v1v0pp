<h2>Obtain the index of SNPs inside a block with defined size</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Selects a random block of a smaller size from a larger contig and obtain the
index of the SNPs that are contained within that block.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">indexSNPs(positions, range, window)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>positions</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a numeric vector where each entry corresponds to the
position of a SNP present in the contig.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>range</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a numeric vector with two entries: the first is the minimum
position of any SNP of the contig and the second is the maximum position of
any SNP in that same contig.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>window</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a non-negative integer indicating the size, in base pairs,
of the block of the contig to keep.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function starts by removing the edges of the contig. The size of the
removed portion is equal to the size of the block to keep. Then, a SNP is
randomly pick from the vector of all possible SNP positions. An initial block
is constructed by selecting all SNPs contained in a window of <code>window</code>
size, both upstream and downstream from that SNP. Finally, SNPs are removed
from both ends of that initial block until all remaining SNPs are contained
within a block of <code>window</code> size.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a numeric vector containing the index of the SNPs present within a
randomly selected window of a given contig.
