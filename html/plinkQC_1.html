<h2>Check and construct PLINK sample and marker filters</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>checkFiltering checks that the file names with the individuals and markers to
be filtered can be found. If so, it constructs the command for filtering
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">checkFiltering(
  keep_individuals = NULL,
  remove_individuals = NULL,
  extract_markers = NULL,
  exclude_markers = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep_individuals</code></td>
<td>
<p>[character] Path to file with individuals to be
retained in the analysis. The file has to be a space/tab-delimited text file
with family IDs in the first column and within-family IDs in the second
column. All samples not listed in this file will be removed from the current
analysis. See <a href="https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/filter#indiv">https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/filter#indiv</a>.
Default: NULL, i.e. no filtering on individuals.</p>

separated by spaces). All unlisted variants will be removed from the current
analysis. See <a href="https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/filter#snp">https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/filter#snp</a>.
