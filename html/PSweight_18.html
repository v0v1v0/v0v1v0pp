<h2>Calculate summary statistics for propensity score weighting</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>SumStat</code> is used to generate distributional plots of the estimated propensity scores and balance
diagnostics after propensity score weighting.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SumStat(
  ps.formula = NULL,
  ps.estimate = NULL,
  trtgrp = NULL,
  Z = NULL,
  covM = NULL,
  zname = NULL,
  xname = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  weight = "overlap",
  delta = 0,
  method = "glm",
  ps.control = list()
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ps.formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class <code>formula</code> (or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the propensity score model to be fitted. Additional details of model specification are given under "Details". This argument is optional if <code>ps.estimate</code> is not <code>NULL</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ps.estimate</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional matrix or data frame containing estimated (generalized) propensity scores for each observation. Typically, this is an N by J matrix, where N is the number of observations and J is the total number of treatment levels. Preferably, the column names of this matrix should match the names of treatment level, if column names are missing or there is a mismatch, the column names would be assigned according to the alphabatic order of treatment levels. A vector of propensity score estimates is also allowed in <code>ps.estimate</code>, in which case a binary treatment is implied and the input is regarded as the propensity to receive the last category of treatment by alphabatic order, unless otherwise stated by <code>trtgrp</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trtgrp</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional character defining the "treated" population for estimating the average treatment effect among the treated (ATT). Only necessary if <code>weight = "treated"</code>. This option can also be used to specify the treatment (in a two-treatment setting) when a vector argument is supplied for <code>ps.estimate</code>. Default value is the last group in the alphebatic order.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Z</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional vector specifying the values of treatment, only necessary when the covariate matrix <code>covM</code> is provided instead of <code>data</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>covM</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional covariate matrix or data frame including covariates, their interactions and higher-order terms. When the covariate matrix <code>covM</code> is provided, the balance statistics are generated according to each column of this matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>zname</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional character specifying the name of the treatment variable in <code>data</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xname</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional vector of characters including the names of covariates in <code>data</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional data frame containing the variables in the propensity score model. If not found in data, the variables are taken from <code>environment(formula)</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weight</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character or vector of characters including the types of weights to be used. <code>"IPW"</code> specifies the inverse probability weights for estimating the average treatment effect among the combined population (ATE). <code>"treated"</code> specifies the weights for estimating the average treatment effect among the treated (ATT). <code>"overlap"</code> specifies the (generalized) overlap weights for estimating the average treatment effect among the overlap population (ATO), or population at clinical equipoise. <code>"matching"</code> specifies the matching weights for estimating the average treatment effect among the matched population (ATM). <code>"entropy"</code> specifies the entropy weights for the average treatment effect of entropy weighted population (ATEN). Default is <code>"overlap"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>delta</code></td>
<td>
<p>trimming threshold for estimated (generalized) propensity scores. Should be no larger than 1 / number of treatment groups. Default is 0, corresponding to no trimming.</p>

<td>
<p>a character to specify the method for estimating propensity scores. <code>"glm"</code> is default, and <code>"gbm"</code> and <code>"SuperLearner"</code> are also allowed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ps.control</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list to specify additional options when <code>method</code> is set to <code>"gbm"</code> or <code>"SuperLearner"</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A typical form for <code>ps.formula</code> is <code>treatment ~ terms</code> where <code>treatment</code> is the treatment
variable (identical to the variable name used to specify <code>zname</code>) and <code>terms</code> is a series of terms
which specifies a linear predictor for <code>treatment</code>. <code>ps.formula</code> specifies logistic or multinomial logistic
models for estimating the propensity scores, when <code>ps.estimate</code> is <code>NULL</code>.
</p>
<p>When comparing two treatments, <code>ps.estimate</code> can either be a vector or a two-column matrix of estimated
propensity scores. If a vector is supplied, it is assumed to be the propensity scores to receive the treatment, and
the treatment group corresponds to the last group in the alphebatic order, unless otherwise specified by <code>trtgrp</code>.
When comparing multiple (J&gt;=3) treatments, <code>ps.estimate</code> needs to be specified as an N by J matrix,
where N indicates the number of observations, and J indicates the total number of treatments.
This matrix specifies the estimated generalized propensity scores to receive each of the J treatments.
In general, <code>ps.estimate</code> should have column names that indicate the level of the treatment variable,
which should match the levels given in <code>Z</code>.
If column names are empty or there is a mismatch, the column names will be created following
the alphebatic order of treatmentlevels. The rightmost coulmn of <code>ps.estimate</code> is then assumed
to be the treatment group when estimating ATT (<code>"treated"</code>). <code>trtgrp</code> can also be used to specify the treatment
group for estimating ATT.
</p>
<p>To generate balance statistics, one can directly specify <code>Z</code> and <code>covM</code> to indicate the treatment levels and
covariate matrix. Alternatively, one can supply <code>data</code>, <code>zname</code>, and <code>xname</code> to indicate the
same information. When both are specified, the function will prioritize inputs from <code>Z</code> and <code>covM</code>.
When <code>ps.estimate</code> is not <code>NULL</code>, argument <code>zname</code>.
</p>
<p>Current version of <code>PSweight</code> allows for five types of propensity score weights used to estimate ATE (<code>"IPW"</code>), ATT (<code>"treated"</code>), and
ATO(<code>"overlap"</code>), ATM (<code>"matching"</code>) and ATEN (<code>"entropy"</code>). These weights are members of a larger class of balancing weights defined in Li, Morgan, and Zaslavsky (2018).
When there is a practical violation of the positivity assumption, <code>delta</code> defines the symmetric
propensity score trimming rule following Crump et al. (2009). With multiple treatments, <code>delta</code> defines the
multinomial trimming rule introduced in Yoshida et al. (2019). The overlap weights can also be considered as
a data-driven continuous trimming strategy without specifying trimming rules, see Li, Thomas and Li (2019).
Additional details on balancing weights and generalized overlap weights for multiple treatment groups are provided in
Li and Li (2019). For details about matching weights and entropy weights, please refer to Li and Greene (2013) and Zhou, Matsouaka and Thomas (2020).
</p>
<p><code>"glm"</code> is the default method for propensity score estimation. Logistic regression will be used for binary outcomes,
and multinomial logistic regression will be used for outcomes with more than two categories. The alternative method option of <code>"gbm"</code> serves as an API to call the <code>gbm()</code> function from the
<code>gbm</code> package. Additional argument in the <code>gbm()</code> function can be supplied through the <code>ps.control=list()</code> argument in <code>SumStat()</code>. Please refer to the user manual of the gbm package for all the
allowed arguments. Currently, models for binary or multinomial treatment will be automatically chosen based on the number of treatment categories.
<code>"SuperLearner"</code> is also allowed in the <code>method</code> argument to pass the propensity score estimation to the <code>SuperLearner()</code> function in SuperLearner package.
Currently, the SuperLearner method only supports binary treatment with the default method set to <code>"SL.glm"</code>. The estimation approach is default to <code>"method.NNLS"</code> in the <code>SumStat()</code> function.
Prediction algorithm and other tuning parameters can also be passed through <code>ps.control=list()</code> to <code>SumStat()</code>. Please refer to the user manual of the <code>SuperLearner</code> package for all the allowed specifications.
