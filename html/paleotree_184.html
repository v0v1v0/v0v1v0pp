<h2>Scale Tree to Unit-Length</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Rescales all edges of a phylogeny to be equal to a single unit (1, or "unit-length").
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">unitLengthTree(tree)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tree</code></td>
<td>
<p>A phylogeny as an object of class <code>phylo</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Probably not a good way to scale a tree for comparative studies.
What does it mean to scale every edge of the phylogeny to the same length?
</p>
<p>This is not a rhetorical question. First, consider that on a 'reconstructed' tree with only
extant taxa, it would mean assuming the time between births of new
lineages that survive to the modern is extremely constant over evolutionary
history (because the unit-length wouldn't change, unlike the birth-death model,
which assumes lineages that survive to the modern 
accumulate at an accelerating exponential rate, even with constant birth and death rates).
</p>
<p>A paleontological tree (say, under the Fossilized Birth-Death Model) treated with 
this 'unit-length' approach would assuming constancy and rigid homogeneity of 
the timing between the birth (origination events) of new lineages that 
(a) survive to the modern day, or 
(b) are sampled at some future point in the fossil record. 
We should assume even with constant extinction and fossilization rates
that such lineages should occur more frequently as we approach the
present-day.
</p>
<p>Note that in neither of those cases, the 'unit-length' branch-scaling approach
does not produce trees whose edge lengths somehow represent 
the 'speciational' model, where evolutionary change is 
entirely 'cladogenetic' (ala punctuated equilibrium) 
and associated only with branching events. This would only be true
on the true, perfectly sampled tree, which isn't what anyone has.
</p>
<p>Thus, overall, the value of the 'unit-length' approach is rather questionable.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns the modified phylogeny as an object of class <code>phylo</code>. Any
<code>$root.time</code> element is removed.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>As an alternative to using <code>unitLengthTree</code> in comparative studies,
see <code>timePaleoPhy</code>. Or nearly anything, really...
</p>
<p>See also <code>speciationalTree</code> in the package geiger, which does
essentially the same thing as <code>unitLengthTree</code>.
