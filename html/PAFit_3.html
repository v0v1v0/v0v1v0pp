<h2>A collaboration network between authors of papers in the field of complex networks with article time-stamps</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The dataset is collaboration network of authors of network science articles with article time-stamps. An edge between two authors represents an article in common. Time stamps denote article publication dates. The network without time-stamps was compiled by Mark Newman in May 2006 from the bibliographies of two review articles on networks, M. E. J. Newman, SIAM Review 45, 167-256 (2003) and S. Boccaletti et al., Physics Reports 424, 175-308 (2006), with a few additional references added by hand. Paul Sheridan independently supplemented the network with time-stamps and some basic metadata in June 2015. The network is undirected with monthly resolution, and contains no duplicated edges. <code>coauthor.net</code> contains the network. <code>coauthor.truetime</code> contains the real times of processed time-stamps. Finally <code>coauthor.author_id</code> contains author names.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(ComplexNetCoauthor)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>coauthor.net</code> is a matrix with 2849 rows and 3 columns. Each row is an edge with the format (author id 1, author id 2, time_stamp). <code>coauthor.truetime</code> is a two-column matrix whose each row is (time_stamp, real time). <code>coauthor.author_id</code> is a two-column matrix whose each row is (author id, author name).</p>
