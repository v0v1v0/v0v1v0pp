<h2>The Glicko Rating System</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements the Glicko rating system for estimating the relative 
skill level of players in two-player games such as chess. It
extends the Elo method by including a deviation parameter for
each player, representing uncertainty on the rating.   
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">glicko(x, status = NULL, init = c(2200,300), gamma = 0, cval = 15, 
    history = FALSE, sort = TRUE, rdmax = 350, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing four variables: (1) a numeric
vector denoting the time period in which the game took place
(2) a numeric or character identifier for player one (3)
a numeric or character identifier for player two and (4)
the result of the game expressed as a number, typically
equal to one for a player one win, zero for a player two
win and one half for a draw.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>status</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame with the current status of the
system. If not <code>NULL</code>, this needs to be a data frame 
in the form of the <code>ratings</code> component of the returned 
list, containing variables named <code>Player</code>, <code>Rating</code>,
<code>Deviation</code>, and optionally <code>Games</code>, <code>Win</code>, 
<code>Draw</code>, <code>Loss</code> and <code>Lag</code>, which are set to zero 
if not given.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>init</code></td>
<td>
<p>The rating vector at which to initialize a new player 
not appearing in <code>status</code>. Must be a vector of length two
giving the initial rating and initial deviation respectively. 
If different initializations for different players are 
required, this can be done using <code>status</code>. The initial
deviation cannot be greater than <code>rdmax</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gamma</code></td>
<td>
<p>A player one advantage parameter; either a single
value or a numeric vector equal to the number of rows in 
<code>x</code>. Positive values favour player one, while negative 
values favour player two. This could represent the advantage 
of playing at home, or the advantage of playing white for chess. 
Note that this is not passed to <code>predict.rating</code>, 
which has its own <code>gamma</code> parameter.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cval</code></td>
<td>
<p>The c parameter, which controls the increase in the
player deviations across time. Must be a single non-negative 
number.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>history</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code> returns the entire history for each 
period in the component <code>history</code> of the returned list.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sort</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code> sort the results by rating (highest
to lowest). If <code>FALSE</code> sort the results by player.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rdmax</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum value allowed for the rating deviation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Not used.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Glicko rating system is a method for evaluating the skill 
of players. It is more complex than Elo but typically yields 
better predictions. 
Default values are roughly optimized for the chess data analyzed 
in the file doc/ChessRatings.pdf, using the binomial deviance 
criterion. A player one advantage parameter has been added to 
the original definition in the reference. A player one advantage 
parameter is also used for prediction purposes in 
<code>predict.rating</code>.
In this implementation, rating deviances increase at the 
beginning of the updating period, and decrease at the end.
This is slightly different from the Glicko-2 implementation, 
where deviance increases for active players may occur at the end 
of the previous period. In both implementations there will be
an initial increase for existing but previously inactive players.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list object of class <code>"rating"</code> with the following 
components
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ratings</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame of the results at the end of the 
final time period. The variables are self explanatory except
for <code>Lag</code>, which represents the number of time periods
since the player last played a game. This is equal to zero
for players who played in the latest time period, and is
also zero for players who have not yet played any games.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>history</code></td>
<td>
<p>A three dimensional array, or <code>NULL</code> if 
<code>history</code> is <code>FALSE</code>. The row dimension is the 
players, the column dimension is the time periods. 
The third dimension gives different parameters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gamma</code></td>
<td>
<p>The player one advantage parameter.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cval</code></td>
<td>
<p>The c parameter.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>The character string <code>"Glicko"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
