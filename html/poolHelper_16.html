<h2>Reads contributed by each individual</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function simulates the contribution, in terms of reads, of each
individual of a given pool. Please note that this function works for a single
pool and should not be directly applied to situations where multiple pools
were used.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">indReads(np, coverage, probs)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>np</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer specifying how many individuals were pooled.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>coverage</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector containing the total depth of coverage of a given
pool. Each entry of the vector represents a different site.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>probs</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix containing the probability of contribution of each
individual. This matrix can be obtained with the <code>indProbs</code> function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a matrix with the number of reads contributed by each individual
towards the coverage of its pool. Each row of the matrix is a different
individual and each column a different site.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># probability of contribution for 10 individuals at 5 sites
probs &lt;- indProbs(np = 10, nSNPs = 5, pError = 100)

# simulate the number of reads contributed, assuming 10x coverage for each site
indReads(np = 10, coverage = rep(10, 5), probs = probs)
