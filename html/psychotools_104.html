<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data provides individual end-term exam results from a Mathematics 101
course for first-year business and economics students at Universität Innsbruck.
The format of the course comprised biweekly online tests (26 numeric exercises,
conducted in OpenOLAT) and a written exam at the end of the semester (13
single-choice exercises with five answer alternatives). The course covers
basics of analysis, linear algebra, financial mathematics, and probability
calculus (where the latter is not assessed in this exam).
</p>
<p>In this exam, 729 students participated (out of 941 registered in the course).
To avoid cheating, all students received items with essentially the same questions
but different numbers (using the exams infrastructure of Zeileis et al. 2014).
Also, due to the large number of students two groups of students had to be formed
which received partially different items. The items which differed (namely 1, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12) varied in the setup/story, but not in the 
mathematical skills needed to solve the exercises. Prior to the exam,
the students could select themselves either into the first group (early in the morning)
or the second group (starting immediately after the end of the first group).
</p>
<p>Correctly solved items yield 100 percent of the associated points. Items
without correct solution can either be unanswered (0 percent) or receive an
incorrect answer (minus 25 percent) to discourage random guessing. In the examples
below, the items are mostly only considered as binary. Typically, students with
8 out of 13 correct answers passed the course.
