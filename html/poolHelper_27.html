<h2>Probability of contribution of each pool</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function computes the probability of contribution of each pool towards
the total depth of coverage of a single population. If multiple pools where
used to sequence a single population, it is possible that some pools
contribute more than others.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">poolProbs(nPools, vector_np, nSNPs, pError)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nPools</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer indicating how many pools were used to sequence the
population.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vector_np</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a vector where each entry contains the number of diploid
individuals of a given pool. Thus, if a population was sequenced using two
pools, each with 10 individuals, this vector would contain two entries and
both will be 10.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nSNPs</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer indicating how many SNPs exist in the data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pError</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer representing the value of the error associated with
DNA pooling. This value is related with the unequal pool contribution
towards the total number of reads of a population - the higher the value
the more unequal are the pool contributions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a matrix with the probabilities of contribution for each pool. Each
row represents a different pool and each column is a different site.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># probability of contribution at 8 SNPs for 5 pools, each with 10 individuals
poolProbs(nPools = 5, vector_np = rep(10, 5), nSNPs = 8, pError = 50)
