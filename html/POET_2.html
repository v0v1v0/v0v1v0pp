<h2>Cmin - Minimum threshold constant</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is for determining the minimum constant in the threshold that 
guarantees the positive definiteness of the POET estimator.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">POETCmin(Y, K, thres, matrix)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Y</code></td>
<td>

<p>p by n matrix of raw data, where p is the dimensionality, n
is the sample size. It is recommended that Y is de-meaned,
i.e., each row has zero mean.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>K</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of factors. K is pre-determined by the users. 
Suggestions on choosing K:
</p>
<p>(1) A simple way of determining K is to count the number of very spiked
(much larger than others) eigenvalues of the p by p sample covariance matrix of Y. 
</p>
<p>(2) A formal data-driven way of determining K is described in
Bai and Ng (2002):"Determining the number of factors in approximate factor
models", Econometrica, 70, 191-221. This procedure requires a one-dimensional optimization.
</p>
<p>(3) POET is very robust to over-estimating K. But under-estimating K
can result to VERY BAD performance. Therefore we strongly recommend
choosing a relatively large K (normally less than 8) to avoid
missing any important common factor.
</p>
<p>(4) K=0 corresponds to threshoding the sample covariance directly.

<p>choice of thresholding. Users can choose from three
thresholding methods:
</p>
<p>'soft': soft thresholding
</p>
<p>'hard': hard thresholding
</p>
<p>'scad': scad thresholding
</p>
<p>'alasso': adaptive lasso thresholding
</p>
<p>Details are found in Rothman et al. (2009):
"Generalized thresholding of large covariance matrices." JASA, 104, 177-186  
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>the option of thresholding either correlation or covairance matrix.
Users can choose from:
</p>
<p>'cor': threshold the error correlation matrix then transform back to
covariance matrix
</p>
<p>'vad': threshold the error covariance matrix directly.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Model:  Y_t=Bf_t+u_t, where B, f_t and u_t represent factor loading
matrix, common factors and idiosyncratic error respectively.
Only Y_t is observable. t=1,...,n. Dimension of Y_t is p. The
goal is to estimate the covariance matrices of Y_t and u_t.
</p>
<p>Note: 
(1) POET is optimization-free, so no initial value, tolerant, or
maximum iterations need to be specified as inputs.
</p>
<p>(2) We can apply the adaptive thresholding (Cai and Liu 2011, JASA) on either the
correlation matrix or the covariance matrix, specified by the option 'matrix'.
</p>
<p>(3)  If no factor structure is assumed, i.e., no common factors
exist and var(Y_t) itself is sparse, set K=0.
</p>
