<h2>Recurrent asthma attacks in children</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Asthma is occurring more and more frequently in very young children
(between 6 and 24 months).
Therefore, a new application of an existing anti-allergic drug is administered
to children who are at higher risk to develop asthma in order to prevent it.
A prevention trial is set up with such children randomised to placebo or drug, 
and the asthma events that developed over time are recorded in a diary. 
Typically, a patient has more than one asthma event. 
The different events are thus clustered within a patient and are ordered 
in time. 
This ordering can be taken into account in the model.
Such data can be presented in different formats, but here, we choose to use
the calendar time representation. In the calendar time representation, 
the time at risk for a particular event is the time from the end
of the previous event (asthma attack) to the start of the next event
(start of the next asthma attack). 
In describing recurrent event data, we need a somewhat more complex 
data structure to keep track of the sequence of events within a patient.
A particular patient has different periods at risk during the total 
observation period which are separated either by an asthmatic event that 
lasts one or more days or by a period in which the patient was not 
under observation. 
The start and end of each such risk period is required, together with the 
status indicator to denote whether the end of the risk period corresponds to
an asthma attack or not.
