<h2>Generation of upsampled non-diseased subjects titers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function upsamples (by random sampling with replacement) titers from the immunogenicity subset to the required size.
</p>
<p>If the size of the immunogenicity subset matches the required size, nothing happens and the original titers from the immunogenicity subset are returned.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">GenerateNondiseased(blindNondiseasedTiters, nondiseasedCount)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>blindNondiseasedTiters</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector: vector of non-diseased subjects titer values</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nondiseasedCount</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric: total number of non-diseased subjects, required size of the non-diseased population</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The inputs should come from immunogenicity subset. "nondiseasedCount" represents number of all non-diseased patients in the clinical trial.
</p>
<p>Immunogenicity subset populations are obtained from function <code>BlindSampling</code>. Immunogenicity subset represents a sample from the non-diseased population.
</p>
<p>In this function, sampling with replacement to the required "nondiseasedCount" of the immunogenecitry subset is performed. The function is used inside <code>PoDParamEstimation</code> function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>nondiseasedTiters: numeric vector of all non-diseased subjects titers
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Data preparation
data(nondiseased)

## Example 1
# Creating imunogenicity subset, method = "Full"
NondiseasedImmunogenicitySubset &lt;- 
    ImmunogenicitySubset(diseased, 
                         nondiseased, 
                         method = list(name = "Full", 
                                       value = "NA"))

# Number of all non-diseased subjects in the clinical trial
nondiseasedGenerationCount &lt;- nondiseased$N

# Upsampling of non-diseased titers
GenerateNondiseased(NondiseasedImmunogenicitySubset$titers, nondiseasedGenerationCount)
