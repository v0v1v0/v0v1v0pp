<h2>Add Gleditsch-Ward state system codes to your data with Correlates of War state codes.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_gwcode_to_cow()</code> allows you to match, as well as one can, Gleditsch-Ward system membership data
with Correlates of War state system membership data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_gwcode_to_cow(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with appropriate <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> attributes</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>data-raw</code> directory on the project's Github contains more
information about the underlying data that assists in merging in these
codes.
</p>
<p>The user will invariably need to be careful and ask why they want
these data included. The issue here is that both have a different
composition and the merging process will not (and cannot) be perfect.
We can note that a case like Serbia/Yugoslavia is not too difficult
to handle (since "Serbia" never overlaps with "Yugoslavia" in the
Gleditsch-Ward data and Correlates of War understands Serbia as the
predecessor state, dominant state, and successor state to Yugoslavia).
However, there is greater weirdness with a case like Yemen/Yemen
Arab Republic. The script will <em>not</em> create state-year or dyad-year
duplicates for the Correlates of War codes. The size of the original data
remain unchanged. However, there will be some year duplicates for various
Gleditsch-Ward codes (e.g. Yemen, again). Use with care. You can also use
the <span class="pkg">countrycode</span> package. Whether you use this function or the
<span class="pkg">countrycode</span> package, do <em>not</em> do this kind of merging without
assessing the output.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_gwcode_to_cow()</code> takes a (dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year, state-year)
data frame that already has Correlates of War
state system codes and adds their corollary Gleditsch-Ward codes.
