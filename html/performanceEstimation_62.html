<h2>
A function for applying post-processing steps to the predictions of a model
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function implements a series of simple post-processing steps
to be applied to the predictions of a model. It also allows the user
to supply hers/his own post-processing functions. The result of the
function is a new version of the predictions of the model (typically a
vector or a matrix in the case of models that predict class
probabilities, for instance).
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is mainly used by both <code>standardWF</code> and
<code>timeseriesWF</code> as a means to allow for users of these two
standard workflows to specify some post-processing steps for the
predictions of the models. These
are steps one wishes to apply to the predictions to somehow change the
outcome of the prediction stage.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the function can also be used outside of these standard
workflows for obtaining post-processed versions of the predictions.
</p>
<p>The function accepts as post-processing functions both some already
implemented functions as well as any function defined by the user
provided these follow some protocol. Namely, these user-defined
post-processing functions should be aware that they will be called with
a formula, a training data frame, a testing data frame and the
predictions in the first
four arguments. Moreover, any arguments used in the call to
<code>standardPOST</code> will also be forwarded to these user-defined
functions. Finally, these functions should return a new version of the
predictions. It is questionable the interest of supplying both the
training and test sets to these functions, on top of the formula and
the predictions. However, we have decided to pass them anyway not to
precule the usage of any special post-processing step that requires
this information. 
</p>
<p>The function already contains implementations of the following
post-processing steps that can be used in the <code>steps</code> parameter:
</p>
<p>"na2central" - this function fills in any <code>NA</code> predictions into
either the median (numeric targets) or mode (nominal targets) of the
target variable on the training set. Note that this is only applicable
to predictions that are vectors of values.
</p>
<p>"onlyPos" - in some numeric forecasting tasks the target variable
takes only positive values. Nevertheless, some models may insist in
forecasting negative values. This function casts these negative values
to zero. Note that this is only applicable
to predictions that are vectors of numeric values.
</p>
<p>"cast2int" - in some numeric forecasting tasks the target variable
takes only values within some interval. Nevertheless, some models may
insist in forecasting  values outside of this interval. This function
casts these values  into the nearest interval boundary. This function
requires that you supply the limits of this interval through
parameters <code>infLim</code> and <code>supLim</code>. Note that this is only
applicable to predictions that are vectors of numeric values.
</p>
<p>"maxutil" - maximize the utility of the predictions (Elkan, 2001) of a
classifier. This method is only applicable to classification tasks and
to algorithms that are able to produce as predictions a vector of
class probabilities for each test case, i.e. a matrix of probabilities
for a given test set. The method requires a cost-benefit matrix to be
provided through the parameter <code>cb.matrix</code>. For each test case,
and given the probabilities estimated by the classifier and the cost
benefit matrix, the method predicts the classifier that maximizes the
utility of the prediction. This approach (Elkan, 2001) is a slight
'evolution' of the original idea (Breiman et al., 1984) that only
considered the costs of errors and not the benefits of the correct
classifications as in the case of cost-benefit matrices we are using
here. The parameter <code>cb.matrix</code> must contain a (square) matrix of
dimension NClasses x NClasses where entry X_i,j corresponds to the
cost/benefit of predicting a test case as belonging to class j when it
is of class i. The diagonal of this matrix (correct predicitons)
should contain positive numbers (benefits), whilst numbers outside of
the matrix should contain negative numbers (costs of
misclassifications). See the Examples section for an illustration.

colnames(cb) &lt;- paste("p",levels(BreastCancer$Class),sep=".")

## t.malignant     -100         100

## Now the performance estimation. We are estimating error rate (wrong
