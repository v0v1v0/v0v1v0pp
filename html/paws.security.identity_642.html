<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>UserName</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The name of the IAM user for whom you want to enable the MFA device.
</p>
<p>This parameter allows (through its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex">regex pattern</a>) a string of characters
consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no
spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SerialNumber</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The serial number that uniquely identifies the MFA device. For virtual
MFA devices, the serial number is the device ARN.
</p>
<p>This parameter allows (through its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex">regex pattern</a>) a string of characters
consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no
spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: =,.@:/-</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>AuthenticationCode1</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] An authentication code emitted by the device.
</p>
<p>The format for this parameter is a string of six digits.
</p>
<p>Submit your request immediately after generating the authentication
codes. If you generate the codes and then wait too long to submit the
request, the MFA device successfully associates with the user but the
MFA device becomes out of sync. This happens because time-based one-time
passwords (TOTP) expire after a short period of time. If this happens,
you can <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_sync.html">resync the device</a>.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
