<h2>Indexing of filters of different curve types</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Vectors of names of member objects grouped according to their type or optical
properties. Band-pass filters transmit a range of wavelengths, but block
shorter and longer ones. Long-pass filters absorb wavelengths shorter than
their cut-off and short-pass filters absorb wavelengths longer than their
cut-off. Multi-band and single-band pass filters are listed together.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A vector of character strings.
</p>
<p>An object of class <code>character</code> of length 60.
</p>
<p>An object of class <code>character</code> of length 17.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>These vectors include only optical-glass filters with well defined
characteristics.
