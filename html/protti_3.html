<h2>Assignment of missingness types</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The type of missingness (missing at random, missing not at random) is assigned based on the
comparison of a reference condition and every other condition.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">assign_missingness(
  data,
  sample,
  condition,
  grouping,
  intensity,
  ref_condition = "all",
  completeness_MAR = 0.7,
  completeness_MNAR = 0.2,
  retain_columns = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame containing at least the input variables.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sample</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character column in the <code>data</code> data frame that contains the sample name.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>condition</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character or numeric column in the <code>data</code> data frame that contains the
conditions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>grouping</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character column in the <code>data</code> data frame that contains protein, precursor or
peptide identifiers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>intensity</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric column in the <code>data</code> data frame that contains intensity values that
relate to the <code>grouping</code> variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ref_condition</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector providing the condition that is used as a reference for
missingness determination. Instead of providing one reference condition, "all" can be supplied,
which will create all pairwise condition pairs. By default <code>ref_condition = "all"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>completeness_MAR</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric value that specifies the minimal degree of data completeness to
be considered as MAR. Value has to be between 0 and 1, default is 0.7. It is multiplied with
the number of replicates and then adjusted downward. The resulting number is the minimal number
of observations for each condition to be considered as MAR. This number is always at least 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>completeness_MNAR</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric value that specifies the maximal degree of data completeness to
be considered as MNAR. Value has to be between 0 and 1, default is 0.20. It is multiplied with
the number of replicates and then adjusted downward. The resulting number is the maximal number
of observations for one condition to be considered as MNAR when the other condition is complete.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>retain_columns</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector that indicates columns that should be retained from the input
data frame. Default is not retaining additional columns <code>retain_columns = NULL</code>. Specific
columns can be retained by providing their names (not in quotations marks, just like other
column names, but in a vector).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame that contains the reference condition paired with each treatment condition.
The <code>comparison</code> column contains the comparison name for the specific treatment/reference
pair. The <code>missingness</code> column reports the type of missingness.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> "complete": No missing values for every replicate of this reference/treatment pair for
the specific grouping variable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "MNAR": Missing not at random. All replicates of either the reference or treatment
condition have missing values for the specific grouping variable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "MAR": Missing at random. At least n-1 replicates have missing values for the
reference/treatment pair for the specific grouping varible.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> NA: The comparison is not complete enough to fall into any other category. It will not
be imputed if imputation is performed. For statistical significance testing these comparisons
are filtered out after the test and prior to p-value adjustment. This can be prevented by setting
<code>filter_NA_missingness = FALSE</code> in the <code>calculate_diff_abundance()</code> function.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The type of missingness has an influence on the way values are imputeted if imputation is
performed subsequently using the <code>impute()</code> function. How each type of missingness is
specifically imputed can be found in the function description. The type of missingness
assigned to a comparison does not have any influence on the statistical test in the
<code>calculate_diff_abundance()</code> function.
</p>
