<h2>pgee.mixed: Penalized Generalized Estimating Equations for Bivariate Mixed Outcomes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Perform simultaneous estimation and variable selection for correlated bivariate
mixed outcomes (one continuous outcome and one binary outcome per cluster) using
penalized generalized estimating equations. In addition, clustered Gaussian and binary
outcomes can also be modeled. The SCAD, MCP, and LASSO penalties are supported.
Cross-validation can be performed to find the optimal regularization parameter(s).
