<h2>photobiologyLamps: Spectral Irradiance Data for Lamps</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><img src="../help/figures/logo.png" style="float: right" alt="logo" width="120"></p>
<p>Spectral emission data for some frequently used lamps including bulbs and flashlights based on led emitting diodes (LEDs) but excluding LEDs available as electronic components. Original spectral irradiance data for incandescent-, LED- and discharge lamps are included. They are complemented by data on the effect of temperature on the emission by fluorescent tubes. Part of the 'r4photobiology' suite, Aphalo P. J. (2015) <a href="https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2015.1.14">doi:10.19232/uv4pb.2015.1.14</a>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package contains emission spectra for different types of lamps
including LED lamps sold as fully assembled light bulbs or luminaires but
excluding LEDs sold as components requiring separate electronic driver
modules or circuits. Lamps have been measured with an assortment of different
instruments over more than 25 years in our lab or by collaborators. Some of
the lamp types are no longer in production but the data are relevant for the
interpretation of old scientific publications. Data for lamps emitting in the
UV and VIS regions of the spectrum are included in the main data set.
</p>
<p>The main data set <code>lamps.mspct</code> contains spectra for different lamps all
of them measured at air temperatures between 20 C and 25 C complemented by
vectors of names to be used as indexes to extract different subsets of
spectra. These spectral data are normalized to spectral energy irradiance
equal to one at their maximum (strongest emission peak).
</p>
<p>In addition a set of spectral emission for UVB lamps exposed to different
ambient temperatures and a data set from a four channels LED bulb are
included as two additional collections of spectra. Temperature response data
are included both as a <code>source_mspct</code> object and as a <code>source_spct</code>
object (to ensure backwards compatibility).
</p>
<p>The third collection of spectra contains data for the 16 different _colors_
of light emitted by a household four channel LED bulb.
</p>


<h3>Warning!</h3>

<p>None of the spectral data included in this package are based on supplier's
specifications and are only provided for information. The exact emission spectrum
depends to some extent on testing conditions, but more importantly among
individual lamps. It is not uncommon for suppliers to revise specifications
during the lifetime of a product type without changing the product
denomination. There can be also some variation from batch to batch. It is
important to make sure that the type considered exactly matches.
Frequently variations of a lamp type, with type denomination differing in
a single letter or number, have quite different spectral characteristics. In
other words, the data provided here are not a substitute for actual
measurements of the radiation emission spectrum of the lamps actually used in
a given piece of scientific research. For less demanding situations the data
are in most cases reliable enough but perfect agreement with measurements on
other lamps of the same exact type should not be expected. This is specially
true for those data measured more than a few years ago when compared to lamps
being currently sold under the same type denomination.
