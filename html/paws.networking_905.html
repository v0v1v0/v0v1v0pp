<h2>Updates the configuration of the firewall behavior provided by DNS
Firewall for a single VPC from Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/route53resolver_update_firewall_config/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/route53resolver_update_firewall_config/</a> for full documentation.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">route53resolver_update_firewall_config(ResourceId, FirewallFailOpen)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ResourceId</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The ID of the VPC that the configuration is for.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>FirewallFailOpen</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] Determines how Route 53 Resolver handles queries during failures, for
example when all traffic that is sent to DNS Firewall fails to receive a
reply.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> By default, fail open is disabled, which means the failure mode is
closed. This approach favors security over availability. DNS
Firewall blocks queries that it is unable to evaluate properly.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If you enable this option, the failure mode is open. This approach
favors availability over security. DNS Firewall allows queries to
proceed if it is unable to properly evaluate them.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This behavior is only enforced for VPCs that have at least one DNS
Firewall rule group association.</p>
