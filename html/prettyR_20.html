<h3>Details</h3>

<p>‘<span class="samp">⁠htmlize⁠</span>’ allows the user to produce a basic HTML listing from
an existing R script. The script must already run correctly with
‘<span class="samp">⁠source⁠</span>’. If the first line of the R script is a comment starting
with ‘<span class="samp">⁠#title~⁠</span>’ and the ‘<span class="samp">⁠title⁠</span>’ argument is missing, the rest
of the first line will be used as the title of the HTML output.
</p>
<p>If there is any graphic output, the script must contain the necessary
commands to set up the graphic devices. Note that only TIFF, GIF, BMP,
JPEG and PNG graphic images are generally viewable in HTML browsers.
The last two are probably the most reliable, but see their help pages
for more details. The graphic files will be linked to the HTML listing
page so that they should be interleaved with text output and commands.
</p>
<p>If ‘<span class="samp">⁠do.nav⁠</span>’ is TRUE, three files will be output. The first will
be named ‘<span class="samp">⁠HTMLbase.html⁠</span>’, where ‘<span class="samp">⁠HTMLbase⁠</span>’ is whatever string
has been passed as that argument.
If that argument is missing, the function will attempt to munge the
‘<span class="samp">⁠Rfile⁠</span>’ argument into a base name. This file is an "index" file
that sets up the HTML frameset. The second file will be named
‘<span class="samp">⁠HTMLbase_nav.html⁠</span>’ and will be dispayed at the left side of the HTML
output as a "navigation" list using the commands as names. Commands
longer than 20 characters will be truncated. The third file, named
‘<span class="samp">⁠HTMLbase_list.html⁠</span>’, contains the program listing. All three 
files will be written in ‘<span class="samp">⁠HTMLdir⁠</span>’. If this is missing, the path of
‘<span class="samp">⁠Rfile⁠</span>’ will be used.
</p>
<p>If ‘<span class="samp">⁠do.nav⁠</span>’ is FALSE, only one file will be written. It will have
the same content as the ‘<span class="samp">⁠HTMLbase_list.html⁠</span>’ file except without
the name tags for navigation and it will be named ‘<span class="samp">⁠HTMLbase.html⁠</span>’.
</p>
<p>Commands that create or alter connections, such as ‘<span class="samp">⁠sink⁠</span>’ are
"forbidden", not evaluated and marked as comments in the listing.
This prevents such commands from altering the connections necessary
to write the HTML files.
</p>
<p>If there is a function defined in the R script, ‘<span class="samp">⁠htmlize⁠</span>’ will run, but
not write any output after the function definition. This has to do with the
way that ‘<span class="samp">⁠htmlize⁠</span>’ reads command lines from the script file. This is a
bug, so watch this space for a solution.
</p>
<p>The ability to nominate a CSS stylesheet allows the user to customize the
appearance of the HTML output. The most likely use of the ‘<span class="samp">⁠useCSS⁠</span>’
argument is for the user to specify whatever aspects of the HTML display
are to be different from the default browser values in a stylesheet.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>nil</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>As of version 1.1, both ‘<span class="samp">⁠echo⁠</span>’ and ‘<span class="samp">⁠do.nav⁠</span>’ are FALSE by default,
as these defaults seem to be more popular.
</p>
<p>The major differences between ‘<span class="samp">⁠htmlize⁠</span>’ and ‘<span class="samp">⁠R2html⁠</span>’ are:
‘<span class="samp">⁠htmlize⁠</span>’ will run with a minimum of one argument (‘<span class="samp">⁠Rfile⁠</span>’)
and produces very basic HTML output. It requires the graphic devices to be
set up as commands in the R script.
</p>
<p>‘<span class="samp">⁠R2html⁠</span>’ does not require commands for graphic devices, just 
comments at the end of any line that requires graphic output to the HTML
file. It color codes commands and output and is more careful about the 
content of lines it writes.
