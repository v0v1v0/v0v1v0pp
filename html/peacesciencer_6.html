<h2>Add Correlates of War alliance data to a data frame</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_cow_alliance()</code> allows you to add Correlates of War alliance
data to a dyad-year data frame
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_cow_alliance(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a dyad-year or leader-dyad-year data frame (either "directed" or "non-directed")</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Duplicates in the original directed dyad-year alliance data were pre-processed. Check
<code>cow_alliance</code> in the package's <code>data-raw</code> directory on Github for more information.
</p>
<p>This function will also work with leader-dyad-years, though users should be careful with leader-level
applications of alliance data. Alliance data are primarily communicated yearly, making it possible—even
likely—that at least one leader-dyad in a given year is credited with an alliance that was not active in the particular
leader-dyad. The Correlates of War's alliance data are not communicated with time measurements more granular than
the year. Apply these data to leader-level analyses with that in mind.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_cow_alliance()</code> takes a dyad-year data frame and adds information about
the alliance pledge in that given dyad-year. These include whether there was an alliance
with a defense pledge, neutrality pledge, non-aggression pledge, or pledge for consultation
in time of crisis (entente).
