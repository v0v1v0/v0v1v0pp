<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>covNames</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of strings of the covariate names as by the column names in the data argument. The names of the covariates cannot include space characters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fixedEffectsNames</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of strings of the fixed effect names as by the column names in the data argument. Each fixed effect must be of class 'numeric'. If a fixed effect is of class 'character', an error message will appear and the fixed effect will need to be recoded as numeric. The names of the fixed effects cannot include space characters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outcome</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string of column of the data argument that contains the outcome. The outcome cannot have missing values - you could consider predicting the value of the outcome for those subjects for which it has not been observed. The name cannot include space characters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outcomeT</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string of column of the data argument that contains the offset (for Poisson outcome) or the number of trials (for Binomial outcome) or censoring for Survival reponse (coded as 0 or 1). The name cannot include space characters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame which has as columns the outcome, the covariates, the fixed effects if any and the offset (for Poisson outcome) or the number of trials (for Binomial outcome) or censoring (for Survival outcome). The outcome cannot have missing values - you could consider predicting the value of the outcome for those subjects for which it has not been observed. For Survival response censoring must be coded as 0 if the event has not occurred (ie, there has been censoring) and 1 if the event has occurred (no censoring has taken place). The names of the columns cannot include space characters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>output</code></td>
<td>
<p>Path to folder to save all output files. The covariates can have missing values, which must be coded as 'NA'. There cannot be missing values in the fixed effects - if there are, use an imputation method before using profile regression.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hyper</code></td>
<td>
<p>Object of type setHyperparams with hyperparameters specifications. This is optional, default values are provided for all hyperparameters. See ?setHyperparams for details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>predict</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame containing the predictive scenarios. This is only required if predictions are requested. 
</p>
<p>At each iteration the predictive subjects are assigned to one of the current
clusters according to their covariate profiles (but ignoring missing values), or
their Rao Blackwellised estimate of theta is recorded (a weighted average of all
theta, weighted by the probability of allocation into each cluster. For Normal and Quantile response they can also be randomly allocated. See also the option predictType below.
</p>
<p>The predictive subjects have no impact on the likelihood and so do not determine
the clustering or parameters at each iteration. The predictive allocations are
then recorded as extra entries in each row of the output_z.txt file. This can
then be processed in the post processing to create a dissimilarity matrix with
the fitting subjects. The post procesing function calcPredictions will create
predicted response values for these subjects.
</p>
<p>See ?calcPredictions for more details and examples. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>predictType</code></td>
<td>
<p>This can be set equal to "RaoBlackwell" and "random". The default is RaoBlackwell. The random option can only be used for Normal and Quantile response, where the estimated variance of the clusters is considered and the predictive subjects are randomly assigned to a mixture component and then are also randomly sampled within that component.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reportBurnIn</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE then the burn in iterations are reported in the output files, if set to FALSE they are not. It is set to FALSE by default.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>yModel</code></td>
<td>
<p>The model type for the outcome variable. The options currently available are "Bernoulli", "Poisson", "Binomial", "Categorical", "Normal", "Quantile" and "Survival". The default value is Bernoulli.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>The value to be used if alpha is fixed. If a value smaller than or equal to -1 is used then alpha is random, if dPitmanYor is equal to zero (the random alpha option is available for Dirichlet process prior only). The default value is -2 (random alpha). For fixed alpha, if dPitmanYor is in the interval (0,1) then a Pitman-Yor process prior is used instead of a Dirichlet process prior.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dPitmanYor</code></td>
<td>
<p>The discount parameter for the Pitman-Yor process prior. The default value is 0, which is equivalent to a Dirichlet process prior. This parameter must belong to the interval [0,1) and it must be provided together with a non-negative value for alpha. The Pitman-Yor process prior is only available for non-random parameters. Note that the third label switching move is only available for Dirichlet process priors, so it will not be run if dPitmanYor&gt;0. Therefore setting dPitmanYor to a value greater than zero will forse whichLabelSwitch=12.</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>varSelectType</code></td>
<td>
<p>The type of variable selection to be used "None", "BinaryCluster" or "Continuous".

The "BinaryCluster" variable selection is based on the method proposed by Chung and Dunson (2009) "Nonparametric Bayes conditional distribution modelling with variable selection" in the Journal of the American Statistical Association. Both types of variable selection can be used with discrete, continuous or mixed covariates. The default value is "None".</p>

<td>
<p>The label switching moves to run. The options available are moves 1, 2 and 3 ("123"), moves 1 and 2 ("12") and move 3 only ("3"). The moves are described in Hastie et al. (2013). Note that the third label switching move is only available for Dirichlet process priors, so it will not be run if dPitmanYor&gt;0. Therefore setting dPitmanYor to a value greater than zero will forse whichLabelSwitch=12.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>includeCAR</code></td>
<td>
<p>A boolean specifying wether a conditional autoregressive term should be introduced within the model, to take into account possible spatial correlation within residuals. Only for Poisson and Normal response models.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>neighboursFile</code></td>
<td>
<p>The file name of the file specifying neighbourhood graph. It should have the same structure than neighbourhood graph files used in the "INLA" package, and can be produced from a nb object of package "spdep", by the function "nb2INLA" of package "spdep".

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>PoissonCARadaptive</code></td>
<td>
<p>This parameter controls which sampler is used for the parameters of the spatial random effect when the outcome is Poisson. When it is set to TRUE, the adaptive rejection sampler is used. When it is set to FALSE (default) a random walk Metropolis is used. </p>

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weibullFixedShape</code></td>
<td>
<p>This parameter controls whether the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution (for yModel=Survival only) is a global parameter (fixed) or cluster specific. It is equal to TRUE by default.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>useNormInvWishPrior</code></td>
<td>
<p>By default this variable equals FALSE. When this variable equals TRUE, the conjugate Normal-inverse-Wishart prior is used rather
than the independant normal and inverse Wishart priors. If this prior is used, variable selection cannot be used as it has not been implemented.</p>

<td>
<p>If the data contains continuous variables (xModel=Normal or Mixed) and the variables are assumed to be independent for each cluster, the multivariate normal likelihood should be replaced by the independent normal likelihood.

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>useSeparationPrior</code></td>
<td>
<p> A separation prior is used to model the within-cluster covariance matrix for each cluster when the data contains continuous variables (xModel=Normal or Mixed). The default for this option is FALSE. When useSeparationPrior=TRUE, useHyperpriorR1 must be TRUE.</p>

<p>There are more files that can be in the output, depending on which options are used in profRegr. The file _mu.txt for example reports the mean for xModel=Normal, _phi.txt reports the multinomial probabilities for xModel=Discrete, _rho.txt reports the paramters for variable selection, etc. The files usually report one line for each sweep (including burn in if reportBurnIn=TRUE). See Liverani et al. (2015) for more details of the parameters.

<p>Note that for the _gamma.txt for variable selection the results are reported per sweep (each line is a sweep) and within each line by cluster (so for each covariate the switches per cluster are reported in order, before the second covariate is reported for each cluster, etc).
