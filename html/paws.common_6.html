<h2>Get the service configuration from the service object.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Look up the service configuration from the service object, e.g. when
calling <code>svc$operation()</code>, <code>get_config()</code> will look up <code>svc</code>, then get
any configuration stored in it, as if the operation function were
a method and the service object were a class instance.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_config()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>get_config</code> must be called directly by the operation function and
assigned immediately, not provided as an argument to another function.
</p>
<p>We look up the service object then fetch its data so we can both support
documentation tooltips in RStudio and also have class-object-like
behavior. Alternatives that do not support documentation tooltips in
RStudio include reference classes (RC), R6 classes, and any modification of
the functions at run-time, e.g. inserting the configuration into the
function definition for each operation in a particular service object.
