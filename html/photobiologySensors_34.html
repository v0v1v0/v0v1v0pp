<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Spectral data digitized from figures in manufacturer's manuals.
These are typical measured data, and for specific sensor units the
calibration data supplied with the sensor must be used as individual
may differ in their spectral response. Furthermore, the digigitizing
process from figures with a linear scale is prone to errors, which
are specially noticeable in regions of low responsivity.
