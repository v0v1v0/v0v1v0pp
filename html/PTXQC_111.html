<h2>Return a tree plot with a possible alignment tree.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This allows the user to judge which Raw files have similar corrected RT's (i.e. where aligned successfully).
If there are clear sub-clusters, it might be worth introducing artifical fractions into MaxQuant,
to avoid ID-transfer between these clusters (use the MBR-Align and MBR-ID-Transfer metrics to support the decision).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">RTalignmentTree(df_evd, col_fraction = c())
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df_evd</code></td>
<td>
<p>Evidence table containing calibrated retention times and sequence information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>col_fraction</code></td>
<td>
<p>Empty vector or 1-values vector giving the name of the fraction column (if existing)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If the input contains fractions, leaf nodes will be colored accordingly.
Distinct sub-clusters should have their own color.
If not, MaxQuant's fraction settings should be optimized.
Note that introducing fractions in MaxQuant will naturally lead to a clustering here (it's somewhat circular).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>ggplot object containing the correlation tree
