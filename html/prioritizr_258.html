<h2>Evaluate solution importance</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Importance scores (also known as irreplaceability scores) can be used to
assess the relative importance of planning units selected in a solution to a
conservation planning problem.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following methods are available for calculating importance scores
for a solution to a conservation planning <code>problem()</code>:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>eval_replacement_importance()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Calculate importance scores using replacement costs (based
on Cabeza and Moilanen 2006).
These scores quantify the change in the objective
function (e.g., additional costs required to meet feature targets) of the
optimal solution if a given planning unit in a solution cannot be acquired.
They can (i) account for the cost of different planning units, (ii) account
for multiple management zones, (iii) apply to any objective function, and
(iv) identify truly irreplaceable planning units (denoted with infinite
values).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>eval_ferrier_importance()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Calculate importance scores following Ferrier <em>et al.</em> (2000).
These scores measure importance based on how critical
planning units are for meeting targets. They can only be applied to
conservation problems that use targets and a single zone
(e.g., the classic <em>Marxan</em>-type problem). Furthermore – unlike the
replacement cost scores – these scores provide a
score for each feature within each planning unit, providing insight into
why certain planning units are more important than other planning units.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>eval_rare_richness_importance()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Calculate importance scores using the rarity weighted richness metric
(based on Williams <em>et al.</em> 1996).
These score are simply a measure of biodiversity.
They do not account for planning costs, multiple management zones, objective
functions, or feature targets (or weightings).
They merely describe the spatial patterns of
biodiversity, and do not account for many of the factors needed to quantify
the importance of a planning unit for achieving conservation goals.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Broadly speaking, we recommend using replacement cost scores where
possible. This is because they can be applied to any type of conservation
planning problem – regardless of the objective function or number of
zones considered in the problem – and measure planning unit importance based
on degradation of the prioritization.
Although the replacement cost scores can be calculated for small and
moderate sized problems (e.g., less than 30,000 planning units), they may not
be feasible for particularly large problems (e.g., more than 100,000 planning
units). In such cases, we recommend calculating importance scores using the
Ferrier method. This is because the Ferrier method can be
calculated relatively quickly for large-sized problems and it
explicitly accounts for representation targets.
We only recommend using the rarity weighted richness metric
when neither of the other two methods can be used.
