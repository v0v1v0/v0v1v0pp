<h2>Refrigerator Energy Consumption</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Thirty 18 cubic feet refrigerators were randomly selected from a company's
warehouse. The first fifteen had their motors modified while the last
fifteen were left intact. The energy consumption (kilowatts) for a 24 hour
period for each refrigerator was recorded and stored in the data frame
<code>Refrigerator</code>. The refrigerators with the design modification are
stored in the variable <code>modelA</code>, and those without the design
modification are stored in the variable <code>modelB</code>.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 30 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>
 
<dl>
<dt>modelA</dt>
<dd>
<p>energy consumption in kilowatts for a 24 hour period</p>
</dd> 
<dt>modelB</dt>
<dd>
<p>energy consumption in kilowatts for a 24 hour period</p>
</dd>
