<h2>Calculate Canberra Distance</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>When two vectors are given, this calculates the Canberra distance between
them; This is calculated as the sum of the absolute difference between 
corresponding elements divided by the sum of their absolute values, for 
elements that are not both zero only.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">canberra(x, y)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector of the same dimension as x</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The Canberra distance between x and y. For example, between vectors
(1,2,0) and (0,1,1), for position 1 we have (1-0)/1, for position 2 we have
(2-1)/3, and for position 3 we have abs(0-1)/1, added together this results
in 2 1/3, or 2.33. Note that a text distance of zero indicates that the
two vectors are equal, while a text distance of 1 indicates that they have
no terms in common.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">canberra(c(1,2,0),c(0,1,1))
</code></pre>
