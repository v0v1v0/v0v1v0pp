<h2>Creates a new version with a new encrypted secret value and attaches it
to the secret</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a new version with a new encrypted secret value and attaches it to the secret. The version can contain a new <code>SecretString</code> value or a new <code>SecretBinary</code> value.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/secretsmanager_put_secret_value/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/secretsmanager_put_secret_value/</a> for full documentation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">secretsmanager_put_secret_value(
  SecretId,
  ClientRequestToken = NULL,
  SecretBinary = NULL,
  SecretString = NULL,
  VersionStages = NULL,
  RotationToken = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SecretId</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The ARN or name of the secret to add a new version to.
</p>
<p>For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than a
partial ARN. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/troubleshoot.html#ARN_secretnamehyphen">Finding a secret from a partial ARN</a>.
</p>
<p>If the secret doesn't already exist, use
<code>create_secret</code> instead.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ClientRequestToken</code></td>
<td>
<p>A unique identifier for the new version of the secret.
</p>
<p>If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services
SDKs to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty.
The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the
value for this parameter in the request.
</p>
<p>If you generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service
endpoint, then you must generate a <code>ClientRequestToken</code> and include it
in the request.
</p>
<p>This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to
prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are
failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUID-type</a>
value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> If the <code>ClientRequestToken</code> value isn't already associated with a
version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If a version with this value already exists and that version's
<code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> values are the same as those in the
request then the request is ignored. The operation is idempotent.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If a version with this value already exists and the version of the
<code>SecretString</code> and <code>SecretBinary</code> values are different from those in
the request, then the request fails because you can't modify a
secret version. You can only create new versions to store new secret
values.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This value becomes the <code>VersionId</code> of the new version.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SecretBinary</code></td>
<td>
<p>The binary data to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret.
To use this parameter in the command-line tools, we recommend that you
store your binary data in a file and then pass the contents of the file
as a parameter.
</p>
<p>You must include <code>SecretBinary</code> or <code>SecretString</code>, but not both.
</p>
<p>You can't access this value from the Secrets Manager console.
</p>
<p>Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service
does not include it in CloudTrail log entries. If you create your own
log entries, you must also avoid logging the information in this field.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SecretString</code></td>
<td>
<p>The text to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret.
</p>
<p>You must include <code>SecretBinary</code> or <code>SecretString</code>, but not both.
</p>
<p>We recommend you create the secret string as JSON key/value pairs, as
shown in the example.
</p>
<p>Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service
does not include it in CloudTrail log entries. If you create your own
log entries, you must also avoid logging the information in this field.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>VersionStages</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of staging labels to attach to this version of the secret.
Secrets Manager uses staging labels to track versions of a secret
through the rotation process.
</p>
<p>If you specify a staging label that's already associated with a
different version of the same secret, then Secrets Manager removes the
label from the other version and attaches it to this version. If you
specify <code>AWSCURRENT</code>, and it is already attached to another version,
then Secrets Manager also moves the staging label <code>AWSPREVIOUS</code> to the
version that <code>AWSCURRENT</code> was removed from.
</p>
<p>If you don't include <code>VersionStages</code>, then Secrets Manager automatically
moves the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> to this version.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>RotationToken</code></td>
<td>
<p>A unique identifier that indicates the source of the request. For
cross-account rotation (when you rotate a secret in one account by using
a Lambda rotation function in another account) and the Lambda rotation
function assumes an IAM role to call Secrets Manager, Secrets Manager
validates the identity with the rotation token. For more information,
see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets.html">How rotation works</a>.
</p>
<p>Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service
does not include it in CloudTrail log entries. If you create your own
log entries, you must also avoid logging the information in this field.</p>
