<h2>Adaptive Matrices Test data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains real data from the 'Adaptive Matrices Test' (AMT), which is a computer-administered test.
This power test assesses logical reasoning as an indicator of general intelligence. The ability to identify regularities and draw logical conclusions is a very good predictor of long-term success at work. The dataset is sparse, because the test tailores a specific set of items for each examinee's ability level. (More information about adaptive testing: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerized_adaptive_testing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerized_adaptive_testing</a>)
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with two data.frames. The first data.frame 'daten_amt' contains 298 columns and 710 rows. Each row contains responses from on examinee. The second data.frame 'betas' contains the difficulty parameter (1PL) (These parameters came with the raw-score extraction.).
