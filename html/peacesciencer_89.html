<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The user will want to note that the data provided by UCDP are technically not country-year observations. They instead duplicate observations for cases of new conflicts
or new conflict episodes. Further, the original data do not provide any information about the conflict-dyad in question to which those duplicates pertain. That means the most
these data can do for the package's mission is provide summary information. The user should probably recode these variables into something else they may want for a
particular application
