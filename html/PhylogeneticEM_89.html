<h2>Merge several complementary vectors into one.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>merge_complementary_vectors</code> take several vectors with complementary entries
(i.e, vector of same length, that are such that only one vector has a non NA value
for each entry), and merge them into one.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">merge_complementary_vectors(comb, mat)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>comb</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector giving the rows to be kept.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mat</code></td>
<td>
<p>matrix containing the vectors as rows.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The vectors are selected from the entry matrix by comb. At each entry, the vectors
are added using function <code>add_complementary</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>row vector of the same size as entry matrix.
