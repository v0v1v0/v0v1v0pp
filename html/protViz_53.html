<h2>A data set containing tandem mass spectra of an LCMS experiment.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The purpose of <code>msms</code> is for the demonstration of the peptide 
identification methods, e.g., <code>peakplot</code> or <code>psm</code>.
</p>
<p><code>msms</code> contains two tandem mass spectra meassured on a linear ion 
trap coupled to an Orbitrap mass analyzer 
(Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany).
</p>
<p>The protein sample originates from 10
mouse brain homogenate, prepared in sterile PBS containing protease
inhibitors (Complete; Riche, Switzerland) by repeated extrusion through
syringe needles of successive smaller size. To remove gross cellular
debris the homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 2400 rpm
at 4 degrees centigrade.
</p>
<p>The data were acquired withing the Sixth Framework Programm (FP6-37457). 
The project was called SysProt.
