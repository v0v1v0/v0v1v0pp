<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The postulated model overlaps the one used by Jedidi <em>et al.</em> (1997) and by 
Esposito Vinzi <em>et al.</em> (2007) for their numerical examples. 
It is composed of one latent endogenous variable, <em>Customer Satisfaction</em>, 
and two latent exogenous variables, <em>Price Fairness</em> and <em>Quality</em>.
Each latent exogenous variable (<em>Price Fairness</em> and <em>Quality</em>) has five
manifest variables (reflective mode), and the latent endogenous variable 
(<em>Customer Satisfaction</em>) is measured by three indicators (reflective mode).
</p>
<p>Two latent classes showing different local models are supposed to exist.
Each one is composed of 200 units. Thus, the data on the aggregate level 
for each one of the numerical examples includes 400 units.
</p>
<p>The simulation scheme involves working with local models that are different 
at both the measurement and the structural model levels. 
In particular, the experimental sets of data consist of two latent classes with 
the following characteristics:
<br>
(a) Class 1 - price fairness seeking customers - characterized by a strong relationship 
between <em>Price Fairness</em> and <em>Customer Satisfaction</em> (close to 0.9) and a 
weak relationship between <em>Quality</em> and <em>Customer Satisfaction</em> (close to 0.1),
as well as by a weak correlation between the 3rd manifest variable 
of the <em>Price Fairness block</em> (mv3) and the corresponding latent variable;
<br>
(b) Class 2 - quality oriented customers - characterized by a strong relationship 
between <em>Quality</em> and <em>Customer Satisfaction</em> (close to 0.1) and a weak 
relationship between <em>Price Fairness</em> and <em>Customer Satisfaction</em> (close to 0.9), 
as well as by a weak correlation between the 3rd manifest variable (mv8) of the <em>Quality</em> 
block and the corresponding latent variable.
