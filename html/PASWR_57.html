<h2>Rat Blood Pressure</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Twelve rats were chosen, and a drug was administered to six rats, the
treatment group, chosen at random. The other six rats, the control group,
received a placebo. The drops in blood pressure (mmHg) for the treatment
group (with probability distribution F) and the control group (with
probability distribution G) are stored in the variables <code>Treat</code> and
<code>Cont</code>, respectively.  Data are used in Example 10.18.

</dd> 
<dt>Cont</dt>
<dd>
<p>drops in blood pressure in mmHg for control group</p>
</dd>
