<h2>Add rugged terrain information to a data frame</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_rugged_terrain()</code> allows you to add information, however crude,
about the "ruggedness" of a state's terrain to your (dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year, state-year) data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_rugged_terrain(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with appropriate <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> attributes</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Please see the information for the underlying data <code>rugged</code>, and the
associated R script in the <code>data-raw</code> directory, to see how these data are generated.
Importantly, these data are time-agnostic and move <em>slowly</em>. We're talking about geography here.
Both data sets benchmark around 1999-2000 and it's a leap of faith to use these data for comparisons
across the entirety of the Correlates of War or Gleditsch-Ward system membership. Every use of data
of these types have been either cross-sectional snapshots or for making state-to-state comparisons
after World War II (think of your prominent civil war studies here). Be mindful about what you expect
to get from these data.
</p>
<p>The underlying data have both Gleditsch-Ward codes and Correlates of War codes. The merge it makes depends
on what you declare as the "master" system at the top of the pipe (e.g.. in <code>create_dyadyears()</code> or
<code>create_stateyears()</code>). If, for example, you run <code>create_stateyears(system="cow")</code> and follow
it with <code>add_gwcode_to_cow()</code>, the merge will be on the Correlates of War codes and not the Gleditsch-Ward
codes. You can see the script mechanics to see how this is achieved.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_rugged_terrain()</code> takes a (dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year, state-year)
data frame, whether the primary state identifiers are from the Correlates of War
system or the Gleditsch-Ward system, and returns information about the
"ruggedness" of the state's terrain. The two indicators returned are the
"terrain ruggedness index" calculated by Nunn and Puga (2012) and a logarithmic
transformation of how mountainous the state is (as calculated by Gibler and Miller, 2014).
The dyad-year (leader-dyad-year) data get four additional columns (i.e. both indicators for both states
in the dyad) whereas the state-year data get just the two additional columns.
