<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The letter published by the authors contains more information as to what these thetas refer.
The "M1" theta is a variation of the standard Rasch model from the boilerplate information in the LEAD
data. The authors consider this to be "theoretically relevant" or "risk-related" as these all refer to conflict
or risk-taking. The "M2" theta expands on "M1" by including political orientation and psychological characteristics.
"M3" and "M4" expand on "M1" and "M2" by considering all 36 variables in the LEAD data.
</p>
<p>The authors construct and include all these measures, though their analyses suggest "M2" is the best-performing measure.
