<p>[required] The <code>AccountId</code> value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the
vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single
'<code>-</code>' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID
associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an
account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.</p>
