<h2>Transform a distribution of times of stay to a
distribution of staying-time up to observation point under
assumption of steady state.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Transform a distribution of times of stay to a
distribution of staying-time up to observation point under
assumption of steady state.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">X_to_A_dist(dist.stays)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dist.stays</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of probabilities of being at the
hospital for 1:length(dist.stays) days at random time of
observation</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>vector of probabilities of staying
1:length(dist.point) days
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# generate vector of probabilities for truncated Poisson distribution for 
# distribution of times of stay X
dist.X &lt;- dpois(1:70, 4)
plot(dist.X)
# transform to distribution of distribution of staying-time up to observation point under
# assumption of steady state
dist.A &lt;- X_to_A_dist(dist.X)
plot(dist.A)
# transform back to get original distribution
dist.X.2 &lt;- A_to_X_dist(dist.A)
plot(dist.X.2)
