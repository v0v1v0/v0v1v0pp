<h2>LI-COR sensors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A vector of names useful for extracting subsets of spectra from
the <code>sensors.mspct</code> object.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">licor_sensors
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A character vector of names of members of the collection of spectra.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the LI-190SA and LI-190 PAR quantum sensor (PAR = photosynthetically
active radiation) colored glass filters are used to tailor the silicon
photodiode response to the desired quantum response. They have the same
spectral response.
</p>
<p>The type of filter used in the LI-190R PAR quantum sensor is not described,
but improves the spectral response compared to the LI-190.
</p>
<p>The LI-200SA features a silicon photovoltaic detector. This is not a true
'pyranometer' and should be used only in sunlight, and calibrated in
sunlight.
</p>
<p>The LI-210SA Photometric Sensor utilizes a filtered silicon photodiode to
provide a spectral response that matches the CIE curve within Â± 5
light sources.
</p>
<p>The LI-210R Photometric Sensor utilizes a filtered silicon photodiode to
provide a spectral response that matches the CIE curve.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Digitized with 'engauge' or 'DigitizeIt" from manufacturers brochures and
other publications. These are approximate data, both because of the
digitizing process, and because they are either typical values or for a
particular sensor unit. Individual sensor units are expected to differ to
some degree in spectral response.
