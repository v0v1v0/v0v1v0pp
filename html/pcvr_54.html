<h2>Hypothesis testing for fitGrowth models.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Hypothesis testing for fitGrowth models.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">testGrowth(ss = NULL, fit, test = "A")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ss</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list output from growthSS. This is not required for nls, nlme, and brms models
if <code>test</code> is given in <code>brms::hypothesis</code> style as a written statement.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fit</code></td>
<td>
<p>A model (or list of nlrq models) output from fitGrowth.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>test</code></td>
<td>
<p>A description of the hypothesis to test. This can take two main forms,
either the parameter names to vary before comparing a nested model ("A", "B", "C") using an anova
or a hypothesis test/list of hypothesis tests written as character strings.
The latter method is not implemented for <code>nlrq</code> models. If this is a vector of parameters
to test in the model then they should be parameters which vary by group in your original model
and that you want to test against a null model where they do not vary by group.
Alternatively for nlrq models this can be a comparison of model terms
written as <code>"group_X|tau|par - group_Y|tau|par"</code>, which uses a fat tailed T distribution to make
comparisons on the means of each quantile estimate. For GAMs these tests compare the model with
splines either by group or interacting with group to a model that ignores the grouping in the data.
If this is a list of hypothesis tests then they should describe tests similar to
"A.group1 - A.group2*1.1" and can be thought of as contrasts. For brms models the "test" argument
is passed to brms::hypothesis, which has extensive documentation and is very flexible.
Note that for survreg the <code>survival::survdiff</code> function is used so fewer hypothesis testing
options are available and flexsurv models are tested using contrasts via <code>flexsurv::standsurv</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For nls and nlme models an anova is run and returned as part of a list along with the null model.
For nlrq models several assumptions are made and a likelihood ratio test for each tau
is run and returned as a list.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing an anova object comparing non-linear growth models and the null model.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
set.seed(123)
simdf &lt;- growthSim("logistic",
  n = 20, t = 25,
  params = list("A" = c(200, 160), "B" = c(13, 11), "C" = c(3, 3.5))
)
ss &lt;- suppressMessages(growthSS(
  model = "logistic", form = y ~ time | id / group,
  df = simdf, type = "nlrq"
))
fit &lt;- fitGrowth(ss)
testGrowth(ss, fit, "A")
testGrowth(ss, fit, "a|0.5|A &gt; b|0.5|A")

ss2 &lt;- suppressMessages(growthSS(
  model = "logistic", form = y ~ time | id / group,
  df = simdf, type = "nls"
))
fit2 &lt;- fitGrowth(ss2)
testGrowth(ss2, fit2, "A")$anova
coef(fit2) # check options for contrast testing
