<h2>Check for samples that are incomparable due to missing data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>If two samples share no loci typed in common, they are incomparable and will
produce missing data in a distance matrix, which could lead to problems with
further analyses. This function finds these samples and returns a matrix of
how many other samples these are incomparable with.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">incomp(gid)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gid</code></td>
<td>
<p>a genind or genclone object</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a square matrix with samples that are incomparable
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
data(nancycats)
# These two populations have no samples that are incomparable
incomp(nancycats[pop = c(1, 17)])

# If you reduce the number of loci, we find that there are 
# incomparable samples.
incomp(nancycats[pop = c(1, 17), loc = c(1, 4)])
</code></pre>
