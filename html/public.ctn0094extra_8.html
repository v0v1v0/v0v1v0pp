<h2>Patient TLFB Opioid Weekly Pattern Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Show the pattern of positive and negative patient self-report
(timeline follow-back, TLFB) results for opioids by patient over the study
protocol. Study "Week 1" starts the day after randomization (for patients
who were randomized) or the day after signed consent (for patients who
were not randomized).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(derived_weeklyTLFBPattern)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A tibble with 3,560
rows and columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>who</dt>
<dd>
<p>Patient ID</p>
</dd>
<dt>startWeek</dt>
<dd>
<p>The start of the "word" is how many weeks before
randomization? This should be -4 for most people, but can be as high
as -8. Note that week 0 is included, so a value of -4 represents data
in the 5th week before randomization; that is, 29-35 days prior to
randomization. Most subjects have timeline follow-back data 30 days
before consent, and delays between consent and randomization are
common.</p>
</dd>
<dt>randWeek1</dt>
<dd>
<p>Week of first randomization (1, if randomized; NA if
not)</p>
</dd>
<dt>randWeek2</dt>
<dd>
<p>Week of second randomization (only for CTN-0030)</p>
</dd>
<dt>endWeek</dt>
<dd>
<p>The end of the "word" is how many weeks after
randomization? This depends on the study protocol, but should be
close to 16 or 24 weeks for most subjects.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Baseline</dt>
<dd>
<p>A character string of symbols from <code>startWeek</code> to
the last week before <code>randWeek1</code>. Symbols are as defined in
<code>Phase_1</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Phase_1</dt>
<dd>
<p>A character string of symbols from <code>randWeek1</code>
to <code>endWeek</code> (for subjects from CTN-0027 and CTN-0051) or the
last week before <code>randWeek2</code> (for CTN-0030). These symbols are:
<code>"+"</code> = the subject reported the use of an opioid for two or more
days in that week; <code>"-"</code> = the subject did not report use of an
opioid in that week; <code>"*"</code> = the subject reported one day of
opioid use in that week; <code>"o"</code> if the subject was supposed to
report TLFB but did not; and <code>"_"</code> to represent weeks wherein the
subject was not scheduled to provide TLFB (for example, more than 30
days before randomization).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Phase_2</dt>
<dd>
<p>A character string of symbols from <code>randWeek2</code>
to <code>endWeek</code> for subjects from CTN-0030 only. Symbols are as
defined in <code>Phase_1</code>.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This data set contains a "word" describing weekly non-study opioid
use patterns as reported by the subject in TLFB. Based on the substances
reported by the subjects, our list of substances classified as an opioid
is: non-study Buprenorphine, non-study Methadone, heroin, and "opioids"
(which includes Oxymorphone, Opium, Fentanyl, Hydromorphone, Codeine,
Suboxone, Tramadol, Morphine, Hydrocodone, and Oxycodone). TLFB reporting
indicating the presence of two or more use days of these substances will
be marked with <code>"+"</code> for that week. TLFB results positive for these
substances for 0 days will be marked with <code>"-"</code>. TLFB results
positive for these substances for 1 day in the week will be marked with
<code>"*"</code> for that week. This data set is a derived data set; the script
used to create it is
<code>"scripts/create_weeklyTLFBPattern_20220511.R"</code>.
</p>
<p>NOTE: some studies collected more TLFB data than others. Also, all times
are marked starting with the week of randomization. We represent the weeks
before randomization with <code>"_"</code> if no TLFB data was collected. For
subjects who were never randomized, all subsequent protocol weeks are
marked as missing (<code>"o"</code>).
