<h2>Data on time until drivers honked their horn when being blocked from an intersection</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Diekmann et al. (1996) investigated the association between driver
characteristics and social status of cars to aggressive driver
responses by measuring the time that elapsed between the being
blocked and honking the horn. Researchers intentionally blocked
57 motorists at a green light by a Volkswagen Jetta, and recorded
the time it took for motorists to show signs of aggression.
Signs of aggression included honking their horn or beaming
the headlights at the Jetta
