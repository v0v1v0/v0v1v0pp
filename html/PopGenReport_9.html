<h2>Individual genetic distance calculation based on Smouse and Peakall 1999</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate pairwise genetic distances between all individuals using the
individual genetic distance measure of Smouse and Peakall (1999). This
function should produce the same results as the individual genetic distances
calculated using GenAlEx and choosing the interpolate missing data option.
Note that depending on your computers capabilities, you may run into memory
errors when this function is used on datasets with large numbers of
individuals (&gt;1000). Additionally, the time for this function to run can be
quite lengthy. Using a PC with a 3.5 GHz processor to calculate pairwise
genetic distances between individuals with 36 diploid loci it took 2 seconds
for 100 individuals, 51 seconds for 500 individuals, 200 seconds for 1000
individuals, 836 seconds (~14 minutes) for 2000 individuals, and 1793
seconds (~30 minutes) for 3000 individuals.  Please note that for each of
your population groupings there must be at least one individual with
genotyped alleles for each locus (it doesn't have to be the same individual
for every locus). If a population doesn't meet this requirement, it will be
dropped from the analysis and a warning message will be generated.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gd.smouse(population, verbose = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>population</code></td>
<td>
<p>this is the <code>genind</code> object that the analysis
will be based on.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>information on progress. For large data sets this could be
informative as it allows the user to estimate the amount of time remaining
until the function is complete. The counter shows the number of the
population for which genetic distances are currently being determined.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns pairwise individual genetic distances for each individual
within a population.
