<h2>pop: A Flexible Syntax for Population Dynamic Modelling</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Models of population dynamics underpin a range of analyses and
applications in ecology and epidemiology. The various approaches for
fitting and analysing these models (MPMs, IPMs, ODEs, POMPs, PVA, with and
without metapopulation structure) are generally fitted using different
software, each with a different interface. This makes it difficult to
combine various modelling approaches and data types to solve a given
problem. pop aims to provide a flexible and easy to use common interface
for constructing population dynamic models and enabling to them to be
fitted and analysed in various ways.
