<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Photosynthetically active radiation (400-700 nm) as proposed by
McCree (1972), and currently used in plant sciences, gives equal weight to
photons within its range, thus weights increase with increasing wavelength
when expressed as energy. PAR is normally expressed as photon irradiance or
(photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD) using implicitly 1 as weight for
all wavelengths (a BSWF). It is also possible, but very unusual, to express
the quantity PAR as defined in McCree (1972) as an <em>energy</em>
irradiance, in which case a BSWF with weights different from 1 needs to be
used. In this case the default normalization wavelength for the PAR BSWF is
set at 550 nm (my own choice).
</p>
<p>A proposal (see Zhen et al., 2021), defines extended photosynthetically
active radiation (400-750 nm) as an alternative to PAR. The need to
consider far-red photons as drivers of photosynthesis has become apparent
with the increased use of LEDs for plant cultivation. WARNING: the proposed
definition limits photon irradiance in the range 700-750 nm to a maximum of
30
larger than 1.4 times PAR even in the presence of far-red photons in
excess, because far-red photons have only a synergistic effect on
photosynthesis in PAR. Ensuring this condition is fulfilled is the
responsibility of the user of <code>PAR()</code>, <code>ePAR()</code> and <code>PhR()</code>
functions. Currently, ePAR can usefully complement PAR, but in my
opinion, it is far too early for it to replace PAR.
</p>
<p>Some earlier definitions, described by McCree (1972a) citing Gabrielsen and
Gaastra, used this same wavelength range but assuming wavelength-invariant
response to energy within this same range, thus weights decrease with
increasing wavelength when expressed as photons. McCree (1972a) cites
Nichiporovich for a similar energy based quantity but covering a wider
range of wavelengths (380-710 nm). McCree's definition from 1972 is
currently the one preferred by most researchers and used almost universally
in the plant sciences, while others are only of historical interest.
Photosynthetic radiation (400-700 nm) is defined as a wavelength range and
does not implement the spectral weighting inherent to McCree's (1972)
definition of PAR or the earlier energy-based ones described by McCree
(1972a).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>For PhR, a waveband object defining a wavelength range . For PAR, a
waveband object implementing the response curve of PAR as defined by McCree
(1972) and thus including a weighting function used in computation of
energy-base PAR irradiances. The weights are normalized to 1 at 550 nm. The
waveband label is set to "PAR" or "PhR" accordingly.
</p>


<h3>Warnings</h3>

<p>PAR is sometimes described as a range of wavelengths (e.g., Both et al.,
2015), which can be confusing as there is more to McCree's (1972) definition,
an spectral response function by which all photons within the range of PAR
elicit the same strength of response. As long as PAR is expressed as a
photon irradiance or a photon irradiation, this, of course, makes no
difference.
</p>
<p>ePAR and PAR are meant to be use to quantify light sources with a broad
spectrum, i.e., sources giving out white light or pale-coloured light. PAR
and ePAR are technical measures of light useful for plants in the same way as
illuminance is a measure of how bright light feels to an average human. They
were never meant to describe the response to be expected from an individual
in particular, be it a plant or human. They are generalizations, that allow
us to consistently measure light in different situations.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><code>PAR()</code> and <code>PhR()</code> call the same function definition with
different default arguments.
</p>
<p>The default for the normalization wavelength at 550 nm keeps the average
weights across the waveband equal to unity, except the special case of
ePAR, where the photons in the extension to the range act by synergy.
</p>
<p>Standard DIN 5031-10:2018-03 Defines two BSWFs <em>sy1</em>
and <em>sy2</em> for photosynthesis, none of which are currently implemented
in 'photobiologyWavebands'.
