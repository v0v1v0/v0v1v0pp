<h2>Simulate Time-Series of Successive Fossil Assemblages</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a set of parameters and models describing species abundance,
stochastically models changes in an underlying biotic gradient and simulates
ecological change and a sequence of samples representing change in recovered
fossil assemblages over that interval, 
including estimating the recovered gradient.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>kdeRescaled</code></td>
<td>
<p>The list of modeled KDEs for species abundance, output from <code>getSpeciesSpecificRescaledKDE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>probSpeciesOccur</code></td>
<td>
<p>The output from <code>getProbOccViaPresAbs</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>origAbundData</code></td>
<td>
<p>The original matrix of abundance data, to be used to
project the simulated data into the same detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) space.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>eventChangeScale</code></td>
<td>
<p>A value indicating the amount relative to 
the background value (<code>bgGradientValue</code>) and the maximum 
possible change as indicated by <code>fullGradientRange</code> 
(in other words, simulated change must be within observed gradient, 
so <code>eventChangeScale</code> is a proportional multiplier of 
the total possible change).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bgGradientValue</code></td>
<td>
<p>The gradient value expected during 
background intervals during which no notable excursion is 
occurring on that environmental gradient.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fullGradientRange</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of two values giving the minimum 
and maximum gradient values observed in the empirical data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>eventSampleWidthRatio</code></td>
<td>
<p>How long should an event be relative 
to the amount of time (or sediment) captured within a sedimentary sample? 
This parameter is used for simulating event duration, 
sample width and sedimentation rate where any two of these three 
are defined and the third is not defined. 
This value is referred to as <em>Resolution Potential</em> 
in Belanger &amp; Bapst (2023).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sampleWidth</code></td>
<td>
<p>The 'width' of a sample relative to core depth 
or outcrop height, usually given in linear units (usually centimeters). 
For taking sediment samples from a core, this is straightforward 
(how thick is each sediment sample taken?) but for outcrops this 
may be more difficult to determine 
(what is the thickness of a horizon in a shale unit?).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>eventDuration</code></td>
<td>
<p>The duration (in time-units) of a 
simulated event during which the environmental gradient 
is at an excursion 'peak' level.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sedRatePerTimestep</code></td>
<td>
<p>The rate of sedimentation, given as a 
ratio of sediment thickness (given in linear dimensions, 
in the same units as <code>sampleWidth</code>), over time 
(given in the same time units as <code>eventDuration</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>samplingCompleteness</code></td>
<td>
<p>The relative completeness of stratigraphic 
sampling. For example, if two-centimeter wide samples of sediment are 
taken from a sediment core, every ten centimeters, then the 
<code>samplingCompleteness</code> is two over 10, or that
<code>samplingCompleteness = 1/5</code>. A simulation with a sampling 
completeness of 1 would be comparable to exhaustively sampling a 
core that recorded no gaps in sedimentation over its history. 
Rocky outcrops are more complicated, as fossil-bearing horizons 
may be relatively thin compared to the thickness of the section, 
such that outcrop-based fossil records should be simulated as 
having <em>very low</em> <code>samplingCompleteness</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>transitionDurationRatio</code></td>
<td>
<p>The ratio of how long the transition 
between peak and background intervals should be, relative to the 
length of the peak 'event' duration (<code>eventDuration</code>). 
The longer this transition interval, the more chances of 
an assemblage being sampled that represents transitional gradient values.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bioturbDepthRatio</code></td>
<td>
<p>The ratio of the sediment depth to which 
bioturbation occurs, made relative to the width of a 
sediment sample (<code>sampleWidth</code>). 
A <code>sampleWidth</code> of 3 cm and a <code>biotubDepthRatio</code> 
of 5 implies a bioturbation depth of 15 cm (<code>3 * 5</code>).  
Bioturbation depth varies considerably in the modern ocean, but is 
often the depth of active bioturbation is about 10 cm, such that the 
top ten centimeters of sediment 
(and the organic remains in those ten centimeters of sediment) 
are being regularly moved up and down by organism activity. 
For the purposes of this model, a bioturbation zone depth of 
10 centimeters means that sampling a centimeter of sediment 
at location X, the apparent fossil assemblage that would be 
recovered is just as likely to include specimens that were 
deposited five centimeters away as those deposited at location X.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bioturbIntensity</code></td>
<td>
<p>The degree of mixing within the bioturbation zone, as a value between 0 and 1. When intensity is 1, a given sample will consist only</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nEvents</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of events to occur in a simulated sequence 
of gradient change.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nSpecimens</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of specimens selected in each individual sample.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>specimensPerTimestep</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of specimens returned in a 
given time-step by <code>getTimestepAbundances</code>, usually set to an 
unrealistically high number to represent the 
true 'unsampled' fossil assemblage. Default is 10000.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>halfGradientOnly</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to simulate only half of 
a background-event sequence, either beginning or terminating 
the simulation at the peak value. 
Only a single event can be simulated, so <code>nEvents</code> must be 1. 
The default is <code>FALSE</code> which signals to not simulated a half-gradient.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>useTransformedRelAbundance</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should the DCA be analyzed</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>projectIntoOrigDCA</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should the new simulated data be projected in the DCA generated by analyzing the original data? This is <code>TRUE</code> by default, which is what most users will likely use, as it is the preferable way to consider how the new simulated data relates to the original data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>powerRootTransform</code></td>
<td>
<p>The power-root transform to be used on the abundance data before applying the DCA. By default this is 1, which means the data is not transformed at all. Note that the power-root transform is only performed if <code>useTransformedRelAbundance = TRUE</code>.</p>

<p>A logical indicating whether 
to include a lengthy background phase, for use in calibrating a simulation. 
This function is mainly for diagnostic purposes

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Different parameterizations may be given as input, 
allowing different parameters to be unspecified.
Missing parameters are then calculated from the specified 
ones using <code>calculateImplicitParameters</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a list, which by default has seven components: 
<code>implicitParameters</code>, the full list of parameters used for generating the simulated data; 
<code>simGradientChangeOut</code>, the simulated time-series of gradient change output by <code>setupSimulatedGradientChange</code>;
<code>maxTime</code>, the total duration of the entire simulated time-series from start to end;
<code>simTimeVar</code>, a data frame specifying time-steps, sedimentary depth and environmental gradient values for simulating a time-series of sampled fossil assemblages, used as input in <code>sampleFossilSeries</code>;
<code>fossilSeries</code>, a list containing the simulated time-series of sampled fossil assemblages from <code>sampleFossilSeries</code>,
<code>ecology</code>, the recovered ecological variables for each simulated sample, 
as returned by internal function <code>quantifyCommunityEcology</code>,
and <code>sampleProperties</code>, a list containing a number of variables specific to individual .
</p>
<p>If <code>thinList = TRUE</code> is used, then the output list
contains only two components: 
<code>sampleProperties</code> and <code>implicitParameters</code>.
The <code>implicitParameters</code> component is the same as in the full output,
but the <code>sampleProperties</code> component only contains information on when 
(in both time and sedimentary depth) a given sample is located in the 
simulated time-series, and the variable <code>scoreDCA1_recovered</code>.
