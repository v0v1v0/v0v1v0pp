</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">iam_create_policy(
  PolicyName,
  Path = NULL,
  PolicyDocument,
  Description = NULL,
  Tags = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>PolicyName</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The friendly name of the policy.
</p>
<p>IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the
account. Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot
create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Path</code></td>
<td>
<p>The path for the policy.
</p>
<p>For more information about paths, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html">IAM identifiers</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.
</p>
<p>This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a
slash (/).
</p>
<p>This parameter allows (through its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex">regex pattern</a>) a string of characters
consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must
begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any
ASCII character from the ! (<code>U+0021</code>) through the DEL character
(<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠U+007F⁠</code>), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and
lowercased letters.
</p>
<p>You cannot use an asterisk (*) in the path name.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>PolicyDocument</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The JSON policy document that you want to use as the content for the new
policy.
</p>
<p>You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for
CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy
in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to
JSON format before submitting it to IAM.
</p>
<p>The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this
operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum
character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length">IAM and STS character quotas</a>.
</p>
<p>To learn more about JSON policy grammar, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_grammar.html">Grammar of the IAM JSON policy language</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex">regex pattern</a> used to
validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the
following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character
(<code>U+0020</code>) through the end of the ASCII character range
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
character set (through <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠U+00FF⁠</code>)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The special characters tab (<code>U+0009</code>), line feed (<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠U+000A⁠</code>), and
carriage return (<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠U+000D⁠</code>)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Description</code></td>
<td>
<p>A friendly description of the policy.
</p>
<p>Typically used to store information about the permissions defined in the
policy. For example, "Grants access to production DynamoDB tables."
</p>
<p>The policy description is immutable. After a value is assigned, it
cannot be changed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Tags</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of tags that you want to attach to the new IAM customer managed
policy. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For
more information about tagging, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html">Tagging IAM resources</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.
</p>
<p>If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum
number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not
created.</p>
