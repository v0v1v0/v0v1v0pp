<h2>Extending the multilateral CCDI price index by using window splicing methods.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function returns a value (or values) of the multilateral CCDI price index (GEKS based on the Tornqvist formula) extended by using window splicing methods. Available splicing methods are: movement splice, window splice, half splice, mean splice and their additional variants: window splice on published indices (WISP), half splice on published indices (HASP) and mean splice on published indices (see <code>References</code>).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ccdi_splice(
  data,
  start,
  end,
  window = 13,
  splice = "movement",
  interval = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>The user's data frame with information about sold products. It must contain columns: <code>time</code> (as Date in format: year-month-day,e.g. '2020-12-01'), <code>prices</code> (as positive numeric), <code>quantities</code>  (as positive numeric) and <code>prodID</code> (as numeric, factor or character).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>start</code></td>
<td>
<p>The base period (as character) limited to the year and month, e.g. "2019-12".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>end</code></td>
<td>
<p>The research period (as character) limited to the year and month, e.g. "2020-04".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>window</code></td>
<td>
<p>The length of the time window (as positive integer: typically multilateral methods are based on the 13-month time window).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>splice</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string indicating the splicing method. Available options are: "movement", "window","half","mean", "window_published","half_published","mean_published".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>interval</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value indicating whether the function is to provide the price index comparing the research period defined by <code>end</code> to the base period defined by <code>start</code> (then <code>interval</code> is set to FALSE) or all fixed base multilateral indices are to be presented (the fixed base month is defined by <code>start</code>).</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function returns a value or values (depending on <code>interval</code> parameter) of the multilateral CCDI price index extended by using window splicing methods. Available splicing methods are: movement splice, window splice, half splice, mean splice and their additional variants: window splice on published indices (WISP), half splice on published indices (HASP) and mean splice on published indices (see <code>References</code>). The time window starts in <code>start</code> and should consist of at least two months. To get information about both price index values and corresponding dates, please see functions: <code>price_indices</code> or <code>final_index</code>. The function does not take into account aggregating over outlets or product subgroups (to consider these types of aggregating, please use the <code>final_index</code> function).
