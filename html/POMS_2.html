<h2>Compute balances at tree nodes.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes balances (i.e., isometric log ratios, for each sample separately) of feature abundances at each non-negligible node in the tree.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">compute_node_balances(
  tree,
  abun_table,
  min_num_tips = 10,
  ncores = 1,
  pseudocount = NULL,
  derep_nodes = FALSE,
  jaccard_cutoff = 0.75,
  subset_to_test = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tree</code></td>
<td>
<p>Phylo object with tip labels matching row names of input abundance table. Note that node labels are required.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>abun_table</code></td>
<td>
<p>Abundance table, e.g., read counts or relative abundance.
Should be dataframe with column names correspond to sample names and row names corresponding to the tips of the tree.
No 0's are permitted unless the "pseudocount" option is set.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min_num_tips</code></td>
<td>
<p>Minimum number of tips that must be found on each side of a node for it to be included (i.e., to be considered non-negligible).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ncores</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of cores to use for steps of function that can be run in parallel.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pseudocount</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional constant to add to all abundance values, to ensure that there are only non-zero values. For read count data this would typically be 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>derep_nodes</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean setting to specify whether nodes should be dereplicated based on the Jaccard similarity of the underlying tips.
When TRUE, nodes with pairwise Jaccard similarity &gt;= jaccard_cutoff will be collapsed into the same cluster. A node will be added to a cluster if it is adequately similar to any nodes in a cluster.
One representative per cluster will be retained, which will correspond to the node with the fewest underlying tips. Note that this step is performed after the step involving the min_num_tips screening.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>jaccard_cutoff</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector of length 1. Must be between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Corresponds to the Jaccard cut-off used for clustering nodes based on similar sets of underlying tips.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subset_to_test</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional vector of node labels (<em>not indices</em>) that correspond to the subset of nodes that should be considered.
Note that balances will still only be computed at each of these nodes if they have a sufficient number of underlying tips (as specified by the "min_num_tips" argument).
If this argument is not specified then all nodes will be considered.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>List containing three objects:
</p>
<p>"tips_underlying_nodes": the tips on the left-hand side (lhs; the numerator) and right-hand side (rhs; the denominator) of each node.
Note that which side of the node is denoted as the left-hand or right-hand side is arbitrary.
</p>
<p>"balances": list with each non-negligible node as a separate element. The sample balances for each node are provided as a numeric vector within each of these elements.
</p>
<p>"negligible_nodes": character vector of node labels considered negligible. This is defined as those with fewer tips on either side of the node than specified by the "min_num_tips" argument.
</p>
<p>When derep_nodes = TRUE, additional elements will also be returned:
</p>
<p>"ignored_redundant_nodes": character vector of (non-negligible) node labels ignored due to being in sharing high Jaccard similarity with at least one other node.
</p>
<p>"node_pairwise_jaccard": dataframe of pairwise Jaccard similarity for all non-negligible nodes.
</p>
<p>"node_clusters": list with the node labels clustered into each unique cluster of nodes based on Jaccard similarities.
Each list element is a separate cluster for which only one node was selected as a representative (whichever one had the fewest underlying tips).
