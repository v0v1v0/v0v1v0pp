<h2>Generate Event Times Conditional On Time-Dependent Covariates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This version of the permutational algorithm generates a dataset in which event and censoring times are conditional on an user-specified list of covariates, some or all of which are time-dependent.  Event times and censoring times also follow user-specified distributions.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">permalgorithm(numSubjects, maxTime, Xmat, XmatNames = NULL,
eventRandom = NULL, censorRandom = NULL, betas, groupByD = FALSE)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>numSubjects</code></td>
<td>
<p>is the number of subjects generated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxTime</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a non-zero integer represening the maximum length
of follow-up.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Xmat</code></td>
<td>
<p>is the matrix of covariates values in a counting process
format where every line represent one and only one time interval,
during which all covariate values for a given subject remains
constant. Consequently, <code>Xmat</code> should have
<code>numSubjects</code>*<code>maxTime</code> rows. Each column of <code>Xmat</code>
corresponds to a different covariates on which the event is conditionned. For fixed-in-time covariates, the same value should be
replicated in each of <code>maxTime</code> row for a given subject.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>XmatNames</code></td>
<td>
<p>a an optional vector of character strings representing
the names of each of the covariates in <code>Xmat</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>eventRandom</code></td>
<td>
<p>represents individual event times. <code>eventRandom</code>
can be a vector of nonegative integer values or a random generating
function with argument n. In both cases, its values must be smaller or
equal to <code>maxTime</code>. If left unspecified, then the algorithm
generates event times based on an uniform distribtuion [1, maxTime].</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>censorRandom</code></td>
<td>
<p>represents individual censoring
times. <code>censorRandom</code> can be a vector of nonegative integer
values or a random generating function with argument n. In both cases,
its values must be smaller or equal to <code>maxTime</code>.  The default is
Uniform[1,maxTime].</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>betas</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a vector of regression coefficients (log hazard) that represent the
magnitude of the relationship between each of the covariates and the
risk of an event. The length of <code>betas</code> should correspond to the
number of columns in <code>Xmat</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>groupByD</code></td>
<td>
<p>groupByD is an option that, when enabled, increases the
computational efficiency of the algorithm by replacing the individual
assignment of event times and censoring times by grouped
assignements. The side effect of this option is that it generates
datasets that are, on average, slightly less consistent with the model
described by <code>betas</code> that those generated  with the groupByD
option set to FALSE. Still, groupByD=TRUE may be  usefull to generate
large datasets where <code>maxTime</code> is much smaller than
<code>numSubjects</code> so that many ties are expected. Default is FALSE.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The gist of the algorithm is to perform a one-to-one matching of
<code>n</code> observed times with independently generated vectors of
covariates values.  The matching is performed based on a permutation
probability law derived from the partial likelihood of Cox's 
Proportional Hazards (PH) model.  
</p>
<p>The number of events obtained in the data.frame returned by the function
depends on both the distribution of event <code>enventRandom</code> and
censoring times <code>censorRandom</code>.  In the simplest case where the
distirbution of <code>eventRandom</code> is Uniform over follow-up U[1,m], and
the censoring is random, the number of observed events in the data.frame
returnd by the algorithm is determined by the upper bound of the Uniform
distribution of <code>censorRandom</code>.  For example, setting the
distribution of <code>censorRandom</code> to U[1,m] will lead to approximately
half of the subjects to experience an event during follow-up, while
setting the distribution of <code>censorRandom</code> to U[1,3/2] will lead to
approximately two thirds of the observed times to be events.
</p>
<p>Subjects without an event before or on <code>maxTime</code> and who are not
censored before <code>maxTime</code> are censored on <code>maxTime</code>
(administrative censoring).
</p>
<p>*** Warning *** Currently the algorithm only takes Xmat in matrix
format. Consequently, factor variables are not allowed. Instead, users need
to code them with binary indicators. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.frame object with columns corresponding to
</p>

each of the <code>n</code> individuals.</p>
</td>

<p>This algorithm is an extension of the permutational algorithm 
first introduced by Abrahamowicz, MacKenzie and Esdaile, and described in
details by MacKenzie and Abrahamowicz.  The current version of the permutational
algorithm is a flexible tool to generate event and censoring times that follow
user-specified distributions and that are conditional on user-specified
covariates. This is especially useful whenever at least one of the
covariate is time-dependent so that conventional inversion methods are
difficult to implement.
</p>
<p>The algorithm has been validated through simulations in Sylvestre and
Abrahamowicz.  Please reference the manuscript by Sylvestre and Abrahamowicz,
