<h2>Fat Cats</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In a weight loss study on obese cats, overweight cats were randomly assigned
to one of three groups and boarded in a kennel.  In each of the three
groups, the cats' total caloric intake was strictly controlled (1 cup of
generic cat food) and monitored for 10 days. The difference between the
groups was that group A was given 1/4 of a cup of cat food every six hours,
group B was given 1/3 a cup of cat food every eight hours, and group C was
given 1/2 a cup of cat food every twelve hours. The weight of the cats at
the beginning and end of the study was recorded and the difference in
weights (grams) is stored in the variable <code>Weight</code> of the data frame
<code>FCD</code>. Data are used in Example 11.4.
