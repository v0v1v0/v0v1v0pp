<h2>Culling of dairy heifer cows</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The time to culling is studied in heifers as a function 
of the somatic cell count (SCC) measured between 5 and 15 days
(measurement day) after calving. 
</p>
<p>High somatic cell count (we use the logarithm of somatic cell count as covariate)
might be a surrogate marker for intramammary infections. 
Heifers which have intramammary infections or which are expected to
develop intramammary infections in the future are quite expensive to keep
due to the high costs for drugs and the loss in milk production.
</p>
<p>Cows are followed up for an entire lactation period (roughly 300–50 days) 
and, if they are still alive at the end of the lactation period,
they are censored at that time. 
Cows are further clustered within herds and this clustering needs
to be taken into account as culling policy and also SCC
in early lactation might differ substantially between the herds.
