<h2>Example 4â€“Evaporation and Homogeneous Redox Reactions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Evaporation is accomplished by removing water from the chemical
system. Water can be removed by several methods: (1) water can be specified
as an irreversible reactant with a negative reaction coefficient in the
REACTION keyword input, (2) the solution can be mixed with pure water which
is given a negative mixing fraction in MIX, or (3) "H2O" can be specified as
the alternative reaction in EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES keyword input, in which case
water is removed or added to the aqueous phase to attain equilibrium with a
specified phase. This example uses the first method; the REACTION data block
is used to simulate concentration of rainwater by approximately 20-fold by
removing 95 percent of the water. The resulting solution contains only about
0.05 kg of water. In a subsequent simulation, the MIX keyword is used to
generate a solution that has the same concentrations as the evaporated
solution, but has a total mass of water of approximately 1 kg. The example
can be run using the <code>phrRunString</code> routine.
