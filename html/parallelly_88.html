<h2>Check If Forked Processing ("multicore") is Supported</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Certain parallelization methods in R rely on <em>forked</em> processing, e.g.
<code>parallel::mclapply()</code>, <code>parallel::makeCluster(n, type = "FORK")</code>,
<code>doMC::registerDoMC()</code>, and <code>future::plan("multicore")</code>.
Process forking is done by the operating system and support for it in
<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> is restricted to Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, Solaris,
and macOS.  R running on Microsoft Windows does not support forked
processing.
In R, forked processing is often referred to as "multicore" processing,
which stems from the 'mc' of the <code>mclapply()</code> family of functions, which
originally was in a package named <span class="pkg">multicore</span> which later was
incorporated into the <span class="pkg">parallel</span> package.
This function checks whether or not forked (aka "multicore") processing
is supported in the current <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> session.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">supportsMulticore(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>TRUE if forked processing is supported and not disabled,
otherwise FALSE.
</p>


<h3>Support for process forking</h3>

<p>While R supports forked processing on Unix-like operating system such as
Linux and macOS, it does not on the Microsoft Windows operating system.
</p>
<p>For some R environments it is considered unstable to perform parallel
processing based on <em>forking</em>.
This is for example the case when using RStudio, cf.
<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/2597#issuecomment-482187011">RStudio Inc. recommends against using forked processing when running R from within the RStudio software</a>.
This function detects when running in such an environment and returns
<code>FALSE</code>, despite the underlying operating system supports forked processing.
A warning will also be produced informing the user about this the first
time time this function is called in an <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> session.
This warning can be disabled by setting R option
<code>parallelly.supportsMulticore.unstable</code>, or environment variable
<span class="env">R_PARALLELLY_SUPPORTSMULTICORE_UNSTABLE</span> to <code>"quiet"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Enable or disable forked processing</h3>

<p>It is possible to disable forked processing for futures by setting <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>
option <code>parallelly.fork.enable</code> to <code>FALSE</code>.  Alternatively, one can
set environment variable <span class="env">R_PARALLELLY_FORK_ENABLE</span> to <code>false</code>.
Analogously, it is possible to override disabled forking by setting one
of these to <code>TRUE</code>.
