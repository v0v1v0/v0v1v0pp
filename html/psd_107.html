<h2>Adaptive power spectral density estimation using optimal sine multitapers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Estimate the power spectral density (PSD) 
of a timeseries using the sine multitapers, adaptively; the number of tapers 
(and hence the resolution and uncertainty) vary according to 
spectral shape. The main function to be used is <code>pspectrum</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In frequency ranges where the spectrum  (<code class="reqn">S</code>)
is relatively flat, more tapers are taken and so a higher accuracy is 
attained at the expense of lower frequency resolution. 
The program makes a pilot estimate of the spectrum, then uses
Riedel and Sidorenko's (1995) estimate of the MSE (minimum square error), 
which is based on an estimate of the second derivative of the PSD (<code class="reqn">S''</code>). 
The process is repeated <code>niter</code> times; further iteration may be necessary 
to reach convergence, or an acceptably low spectral variance. 
In this context the term "acceptable" is rather subjective: one can 
usually detect an unconverged state by a rather jagged appearance of the spectrum,
but this is uncommon in our experience.
</p>


<h4>Adaptive estimation</h4>

<p>The adaptive process used is as follows. A quadratic fit to the logarithm of the
PSD within an adaptively determined frequency band is used to find an estimate of the local second 
derivative of the spectrum. This is used in an equation like R-S equation (13) for 
the MSE taper number, with the difference that a parabolic weighting is applied with 
increasing taper order. Because the FFTs of the tapered series can be found by 
resampling the FFT of the original time series (doubled in length and padded with zeros) 
only one FFT is required per series, no matter how many tapers are used. 
The spectra associated with the sine tapers are weighted before averaging with a 
parabolically varying weight. The expression for the optimal number of tapers 
given by R-S must be modified since it gives an unbounded result near points 
where <code class="reqn">S''</code> vanishes, which happens at many points in most spectra. 
This program restricts the rate of growth of the number of tapers so that a 
neighboring covering interval estimate is never completely contained in the next 
such interval.
</p>



<h4>Resolution and uncertainty</h4>

<p>The sine multitaper adaptive process 
introduces a variable resolution and error in the frequency domain. 
See documentation for <code>spectral_properties</code> details on
how these are computed.
