<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Chart Quadrat Dataset for grassland species in MT and AZ
An example dataset that contains data from mapped plant chart quadrats. Each
row is an observation of one plant.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">grasslandData
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An sf data frame with 1242 rows and 15 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Species</dt>
<dd>
<p>A character string indicating the specific epithet for this
observation. The ideal formats are the 1) the latin binomial separated by
a space (i.e. "Bouteloua gracilis"), 2) the latin binomial separated by an
underscore (i.e. "Bouteloua_gracilis"), or 3) a species code consisting of
the first n' letters of each element of the latin binomial (i.e. "BOUGRA"
or "BOGR"). Whichever format is used, it must be used for all rows.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Clone</dt>
<dd>
<p>An integer vector. (1) indicates that this individual is a
clone (genet). (0) indicates that this individual is not a clone. NA
indicates that this data was not recorded.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Seedling</dt>
<dd>
<p>An integer vector indicating whether this observation was a
seedling (1), or not (0). This data was not collected for many
observations, which have an NA in this column. </p>
</dd>
<dt>Stems</dt>
<dd>
<p>An integer greater than 0 indicating how many stems were
present for the observed plant. This data was not collected for many
observations, which have an NA in this column.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Basal</dt>
<dd>
<p>An integer vector. (1) indicates that the basal area of
this individual was mapped. (0) indicates that the basal area of this
individual was not mapped (in which case it cannot be used in the
<code>assign</code> function.) NA indicates that this data was not
recorded.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Type</dt>
<dd>
<p>A factor with two levels: 'point' or 'poly', which indicates
whether the observation was originally mapped as a 'point' or a 'polygon'.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Site</dt>
<dd>
<p>A character string indicating the sampling location of this
observation. In this dataset, this value is either:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p>AZ (Santa Rita Experimental Range, Tucson, AZ)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>MT (Fort Keogh Livestock and Range Research Laboratory,
Miles City, MT)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Quad</dt>
<dd>
<p>A character string indicating the name of the quadrat where
this plant was mapped.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Year</dt>
<dd>
<p>An integer indicating the year when this plant was mapped.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sp_code_4</dt>
<dd>
<p>A character string of the 4-letter species code for this
observation (The first two letters of the genus name, and first two letters
of the species name, capitalized with no spaces).</p>
</dd>
<dt>sp_code_6</dt>
<dd>
<p>A character string of the 6-letter species code for this
observation (The first three letters of the genus name, and first three
letters of the species name, capitalized with no spaces).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Area</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric variable indicating the basal area in m^2 of this
observation. In this dataset, observations originally mapped as points were
assigned an area of 2.46e-05 m^2. For individuals mapped as polygons, the
value in this column indicates the basal area of that plant.</p>
</dd>
<dt>geometry</dt>
<dd>
<p>The sf geometry of class "MULTIPOLYGON" for
this observation. The location of this polygon indicates the plant's
location in a 1 m x 1 m square. If the plant was mapped as a polygon,
the area of this polygon indicates the basal area of that plant.</p>
</dd>
