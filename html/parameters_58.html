<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In classical null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) within a frequentist
framework, it is not possible to accept the null hypothesis, H0 - unlike
in Bayesian statistics, where such probability statements are possible.
"... one can only reject the null hypothesis if the test
statistics falls into the critical region(s), or fail to reject this
hypothesis. In the latter case, all we can say is that no significant effect
was observed, but one cannot conclude that the null hypothesis is true."
(<em>Pernet 2017</em>). One way to address this issues without Bayesian methods
is <em>Equivalence Testing</em>, as implemented in <code>equivalence_test()</code>.
While you either can reject the null hypothesis or claim an inconclusive result
in NHST, the equivalence test - according to <em>Pernet</em> - adds a third category,
<em>"accept"</em>. Roughly speaking, the idea behind equivalence testing in a
frequentist framework is to check whether an estimate and its uncertainty
(i.e. confidence interval) falls within a region of "practical equivalence".
Depending on the rule for this test (see below), statistical significance
does not necessarily indicate whether the null hypothesis can be rejected or
not, i.e. the classical interpretation of the p-value may differ from the
results returned from the equivalence test.
</p>


<h4>Calculation of equivalence testing</h4>


<ul>
<li>
<p> "bayes" - Bayesian rule (Kruschke 2018)
</p>
<p>This rule follows the "HDI+ROPE decision rule" (<em>Kruschke, 2014, 2018</em>) used
for the <code>Bayesian counterpart()</code>. This
means, if the confidence intervals are completely outside the ROPE, the
"null hypothesis" for this parameter is "rejected". If the ROPE
completely covers the CI, the null hypothesis is accepted. Else, it's
undecided whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis. Desirable
results are low proportions inside the ROPE (the closer to zero the
better).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "classic" - The TOST rule (Lakens 2017)
</p>
<p>This rule follows the "TOST rule", i.e. a two one-sided test procedure
(<em>Lakens 2017</em>). Following this rule...
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> practical equivalence is assumed (i.e. H0 <em>"accepted"</em>) when the narrow
confidence intervals are completely inside the ROPE, no matter if the
effect is statistically significant or not;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> practical equivalence (i.e. H0) is <em>rejected</em>, when the coefficient is
statistically significant, both when the narrow confidence intervals
(i.e. <code>1-2*alpha</code>) include or exclude the the ROPE boundaries, but the
narrow confidence intervals are <em>not fully covered</em> by the ROPE;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> else the decision whether to accept or reject practical equivalence is
undecided (i.e. when effects are <em>not</em> statistically significant <em>and</em>
the narrow confidence intervals overlaps the ROPE).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p> "cet" - Conditional Equivalence Testing (Campbell/Gustafson 2018)
</p>
<p>The Conditional Equivalence Testing as described by <em>Campbell and
Gustafson 2018</em>. According to this rule, practical equivalence is
rejected when the coefficient is statistically significant. When the
effect is <em>not</em> significant and the narrow confidence intervals are
completely inside the ROPE, we accept (i.e. assume) practical equivalence,
else it is undecided.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Levels of Confidence Intervals used for Equivalence Testing</h4>

<p>For <code>rule = "classic"</code>, "narrow" confidence intervals are used for
equivalence testing. "Narrow" means, the the intervals is not 1 - alpha,
but 1 - 2 * alpha. Thus, if <code>ci = .95</code>, alpha is assumed to be 0.05
and internally a ci-level of 0.90 is used. <code>rule = "cet"</code> uses
both regular and narrow confidence intervals, while <code>rule = "bayes"</code>
only uses the regular intervals.
</p>



<h4>p-Values</h4>

<p>The equivalence p-value is the area of the (cumulative) confidence
distribution that is outside of the region of equivalence. It can be
interpreted as p-value for <em>rejecting</em> the alternative hypothesis
and <em>accepting</em> the "null hypothesis" (i.e. assuming practical
equivalence). That is, a high p-value means we reject the assumption of
practical equivalence and accept the alternative hypothesis.
</p>



<h4>Second Generation p-Value (SGPV)</h4>

<p>Second generation p-values (SGPV) were proposed as a statistic that
represents <em>the proportion of data-supported hypotheses that are also null
hypotheses</em> <em>(Blume et al. 2018, Lakens and Delacre 2020)</em>. It represents the
proportion of the <em>full</em> confidence interval range (assuming a normally
distributed, equal-tailed interval) that is inside the ROPE.
</p>
<p>Note that the assumed interval, which is used to calculate the SGPV, is an
<em>approximation</em> of the <em>full interval</em> based on the chosen confidence level.
For example, if the 95% confidence interval of a coefficient ranges from -1
to 1, the underlying <em>full (normally distributed) interval</em> approximately
ranges from -1.9 to 1.9, see also following code:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre># simulate full normal distribution
out &lt;- bayestestR::distribution_normal(10000, 0, 0.5)
# range of "full" distribution
range(out)
# range of 95% CI
round(quantile(out, probs = c(0.025, 0.975)), 2)
</pre></div>
<p>This ensures that the SGPV always refers to the general compatible parameter
space of coefficients, independent from the confidence interval chosen for
testing practical equivalence. Therefore, the SGPV of the <em>full interval</em> is
similar to the ROPE coverage of Bayesian equivalence tests, see following
code:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>library(bayestestR)
library(brms)
m &lt;- lm(mpg ~ gear + wt + cyl + hp, data = mtcars)
m2 &lt;- brm(mpg ~ gear + wt + cyl + hp, data = mtcars)
# SGPV for frequentist models
equivalence_test(m)
# similar to ROPE coverage of Bayesian models
equivalence_test(m2)
# similar to ROPE coverage of simulated draws / bootstrap samples
equivalence_test(simulate_model(m))
</pre></div>



<h4>ROPE range</h4>

<p>Some attention is required for finding suitable values for the ROPE limits
(argument <code>range</code>). See 'Details' in <code>bayestestR::rope_range()</code>
for further information.

<h3>Statistical inference - how to quantify evidence</h3>

<p>There is no standardized approach to drawing conclusions based on the
available data and statistical models. A frequently chosen but also much
criticized approach is to evaluate results based on their statistical
significance (<em>Amrhein et al. 2017</em>).
</p>
<p>A more sophisticated way would be to test whether estimated effects exceed
the "smallest effect size of interest", to avoid even the smallest effects
being considered relevant simply because they are statistically significant,
but clinically or practically irrelevant (<em>Lakens et al. 2018, Lakens 2024</em>).
</p>
<p>A rather unconventional approach, which is nevertheless advocated by various
authors, is to interpret results from classical regression models in terms of
probabilities, similar to the usual approach in Bayesian statistics
(<em>Greenland et al. 2022; Rafi and Greenland 2020; Schweder 2018; Schweder and
Hjort 2003; Vos 2022</em>).
</p>
<p>The <strong>parameters</strong> package provides several options or functions to aid
statistical inference. These are, for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>equivalence_test()</code>, to compute the (conditional) equivalence test for
frequentist models
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>p_significance()</code>, to compute the probability of <em>practical significance</em>,
which can be conceptualized as a unidirectional equivalence test
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>p_function()</code>, or <em>consonance function</em>, to compute p-values and
compatibility (confidence) intervals for statistical models
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the <code>pd</code> argument (setting <code>pd = TRUE</code>) in <code>model_parameters()</code> includes
a column with the <em>probability of direction</em>, i.e. the probability that a
parameter is strictly positive or negative. See <code>bayestestR::p_direction()</code>
for details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the <code>s_value</code> argument (setting <code>s_value = TRUE</code>) in <code>model_parameters()</code>
replaces the p-values with their related <em>S</em>-values (<em>Rafi and Greenland 2020</em>)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> finally, it is possible to generate distributions of model coefficients by
generating bootstrap-samples (setting <code>bootstrap = TRUE</code>) or simulating
draws from model coefficients using <code>simulate_model()</code>. These samples
can then be treated as "posterior samples" and used in many functions from
the <strong>bayestestR</strong> package.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the above shown options or functions derive from methods originally
implemented for Bayesian models (<em>Makowski et al. 2019</em>). However, assuming
that model assumptions are met (which means, the model fits well to the data,
the correct model is chosen that reflects the data generating process
(distributional model family) etc.), it seems appropriate to interpret
results from classical frequentist models in a "Bayesian way" (more details:
documentation in <code>p_function()</code>).
