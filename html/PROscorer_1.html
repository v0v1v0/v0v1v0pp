<h2>PROscorer</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An open-source repository of functions to score specific
Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO), Quality of Life (QoL), and other
psychometric measures commonly used in research.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> package is an extensible repository of functions
to score specific PRO, QoL, and other psychometric measures and
questionnaire-based instruments commonly used in research.  It is intended
to promote best practices for scoring PRO-like instruments, to standardize
scoring procedures for PRO measures across studies, and to improve the
reproducibility of research with PRO-like instruments by providing
accurate, up-to-date, and well-documented PRO scoring functions that can
easily be integrated into scientifically reproducible workflows.
</p>
<p>Additionally, <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> is accompanied by a package vignette that
contains detailed descriptions of each instrument scored by
<span class="pkg">PROscorer</span>, complete with references.  Importantly, the instrument
summaries are written according to a set of standards that ensure they meet
"best practice" guidelines for descriptions of PRO-like measures in formal
research protocols and in reports of research results featuring such
measures.  This means that, with little or no editing, a given instrument
summary can be copied and pasted directly into protocols, grant proposals,
and manuscripts.  In addition to improving the measure descriptions in
research documents, this saves the study investigators considerable time
and effort.
</p>


<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>The scientific rigor and reproducibility of research
involving PRO, QoL, and similar measures is lagging behind other research
areas.  Three major reasons for these shortcomings are (1) measurement
error introduced by faulty scoring procedures, (2) inconsistent application
of scoring instructions across different studies using the same PRO
measures, and (3) inadequate, incomplete, and/or inaccurate descriptions of
PRO-like measures in research protocols and in published results of studies
that incorporate such measures.
</p>
<p>Scoring procedures represent a major source of error in research studies
that rely upon PRO and similar measures.  These errors typically go
unnoticed, hidden, and/or ignored, eroding the scientific integrity of the
research and hindering progress in the numerous scientific fields that
conduct studies that use these measures.
</p>
<p>Similarly, inconsistent application of PRO scoring procedures and
variation in scoring across studies makes study results less likely to
replicate and slows the accumulation of reliable scientific data from the
PRO measure.
</p>
<p>Inadequate, incomplete, and/or inaccurate descriptions of PRO-like measures
in research documents can cause confusion and introduce errors, oversights,
and other mistakes at multiple stages in the research process.
</p>


<h3>The Proposed Solution</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> package provides the
framework for addressing these problems with research involving PRO-like
measures.  The lofty goal of the <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> package is to eliminate
these serious deficiencies in PRO-based research by serving as the
gold-standard open-source repository of scoring syntax and instrument
descriptions for PRO-like measures commonly used in research and clinical
settings.
</p>
<p>The features of the <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> package and supporting infrastructure
were carefully planned with this ambitious goal in mind.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> serves as the repository of scoring functions for
specific, commonly-used PRO measures (e.g., the EORTC QLQ-C30).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> All scoring functions in <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> are written using simpler
functions from a separate package, <span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span>.  The
<span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span> package provides the well-tested, reusable
infrastructure for the <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> functions.  This makes it easy to
write new scoring functions to add to <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span>, and decreases the
chance of errors and other bugs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Advanced users can use <span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span> to write new scoring
functions for their favorite PRO-like measures and submit them for
inclusion in future <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> updates.  As of this initial release,
the system for writing and submitting new functions is immature.  A
vignette will be included in future updates with a guide for writing new
functions and submitting them for review on GitHub.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Functions to score additional PRO measures are currently under development
and will be included in future releases.
</p>


<h3>Please Provide Feedback</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> and
<span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span> packages are still in their initial versions.  As
such, some details and other conventions are still being hammered out,
particularly in <span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span> (e.g., function naming conventions,
argument-checking functions, etc.).  However, any changes to the
<span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> functions are expected to be internal and have little or no
impact on end-users.
</p>
<p>I put a lot of thought into the <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> and <span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span>
packages, and I have tested them as an end-user as well as developer.
However, I cannot anticipate the needs of all users, and I would like your
feedback on your experience using the package(s).  Please let me know if
you found <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> and/or <span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span> helpful.  And please
tell me how I can improve their usability, and definitely report any bugs
or other unexpected behaviors you encounter.  Make feature requests and bug
reports here: https://github.com/raybaser/PROscorerTools/issues
