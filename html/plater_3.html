<h2>Tools to Make it Easy to Work with Microtiter Plate-Shaped Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>plater defines a simple, plate-shaped file format for data storage, so it's 
easy to remember the experimental design. The package provides functions to 
seamlessly convert between that format and a tidy data frame that's optimal 
for analysis. <code>check_plater_format</code> is provided to help 
you manage plate-shaped files. <br><br> You can work with purely plate-shaped 
data (<code>read_plate</code> and 
<code>read_plates</code>), as well as with a combination of 
plate-shaped data and tidy data (<code>add_plate</code>). It further
allows easy plate-shaped visualization of tidy data 
(<code>view_plate</code>).
