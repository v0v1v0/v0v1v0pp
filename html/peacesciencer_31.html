<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The directed dyad-year alliance data are for alliance initiations, not straight dyad-years, "per se." This suggests
the presence of duplicate directed dyad-years. For computing ease, given the intended use, I take care of these duplicate
dyad-years behind the scenes. Consider the case of the U.S. and Canada in 1958. Therein, there were apparently two separate
alliance initiations  that included defense pledges. My behind-the-scenes cleaning process groups by <code>ccode1</code>,
<code>ccode2</code>, and <code>year</code> and summarizes those alliance pledge variables. I then replace any value greater than 1
with 1. This indicates the presence or absence of a defense pledge in a given directed dyad-year.
