<h2>This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads in a bucket</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads in a bucket. An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated by the <code>create_multipart_upload</code> request, but has not yet been completed or aborted.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/s3_list_multipart_uploads/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/s3_list_multipart_uploads/</a> for full documentation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">s3_list_multipart_uploads(
  Bucket,
  Delimiter = NULL,
  EncodingType = NULL,
  KeyMarker = NULL,
  MaxUploads = NULL,
  Prefix = NULL,
  UploadIdMarker = NULL,
  ExpectedBucketOwner = NULL,
  RequestPayer = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Bucket</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.
</p>
<p><strong>Directory buckets</strong> - When you use this operation with a directory
bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
<code> Bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com</code>. Path-style requests
are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen
Availability Zone. Bucket names must follow the format
<code> bucket_base_name--az-id--x-s3</code> (for example,
<code> DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3</code>). For information about bucket
naming restrictions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html">Directory bucket naming rules</a>
in the <em>Amazon S3 User Guide</em>.
</p>
<p><strong>Access points</strong> - When you use this action with an access point, you
must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name
or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you
must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point
hostname takes the form
<em>AccessPointName</em>-<em>AccountId</em>.s3-accesspoint.<em>Region</em>.amazonaws.com.
When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
name. For more information about access point ARNs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html">Using access points</a>
in the <em>Amazon S3 User Guide</em>.
</p>
<p>Access points and Object Lambda access points are not supported by
directory buckets.
</p>
<p><strong>S3 on Outposts</strong> - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on
Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The
S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form
<code> AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com</code>.
When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the
bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html">What is S3 on Outposts?</a>
in the <em>Amazon S3 User Guide</em>.</p>

<td><code>Delimiter</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character you use to group keys.
</p>
<p>All keys that contain the same string between the prefix, if specified,
and the first occurrence of the delimiter after the prefix are grouped
under a single result element, <code>CommonPrefixes</code>. If you don't specify
the prefix parameter, then the substring starts at the beginning of the
key. The keys that are grouped under <code>CommonPrefixes</code> result element are
not returned elsewhere in the response.
</p>
<p><strong>Directory buckets</strong> - For directory buckets, <code>/</code> is the only supported
delimiter.</p>

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>KeyMarker</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies the multipart upload after which listing should begin.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>General purpose buckets</strong> - For general purpose buckets,
<code>key-marker</code> is an object key. Together with <code>upload-id-marker</code>,
this parameter specifies the multipart upload after which listing
should begin.
</p>
<p>If <code>upload-id-marker</code> is not specified, only the keys
lexicographically greater than the specified <code>key-marker</code> will be
included in the list.
</p>
<p>If <code>upload-id-marker</code> is specified, any multipart uploads for a key
equal to the <code>key-marker</code> might also be included, provided those
multipart uploads have upload IDs lexicographically greater than the
specified <code>upload-id-marker</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Directory buckets</strong> - For directory buckets, <code>key-marker</code> is
obfuscated and isn't a real object key. The <code>upload-id-marker</code>
parameter isn't supported by directory buckets. To list the
additional multipart uploads, you only need to set the value of
<code>key-marker</code> to the <code>NextKeyMarker</code> value from the previous
response.
</p>
<p>In the <code>list_multipart_uploads</code>
response, the multipart uploads aren't sorted lexicographically
based on the object keys.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>MaxUploads</code></td>
<td>
<p>Sets the maximum number of multipart uploads, from 1 to 1,000, to return
in the response body. 1,000 is the maximum number of uploads that can be
returned in a response.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Prefix</code></td>
<td>
<p>Lists in-progress uploads only for those keys that begin with the
specified prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into
different grouping of keys. (You can think of using <code>prefix</code> to make
groups in the same way that you'd use a folder in a file system.)
</p>
<p><strong>Directory buckets</strong> - For directory buckets, only prefixes that end in
a delimiter (<code>/</code>) are supported.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>UploadIdMarker</code></td>
<td>
<p>Together with key-marker, specifies the multipart upload after which
listing should begin. If key-marker is not specified, the
upload-id-marker parameter is ignored. Otherwise, any multipart uploads
for a key equal to the key-marker might be included in the list only if
they have an upload ID lexicographically greater than the specified
<code>upload-id-marker</code>.
</p>
<p>This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ExpectedBucketOwner</code></td>

<p>The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you
provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails
with the HTTP status code <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠403 Forbidden⁠</code> (access denied).</p>
