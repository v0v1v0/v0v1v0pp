<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">glue_start_job_run(
  JobName,
  JobRunQueuingEnabled = NULL,
  JobRunId = NULL,
  Arguments = NULL,
  AllocatedCapacity = NULL,
  Timeout = NULL,
  MaxCapacity = NULL,
  SecurityConfiguration = NULL,
  NotificationProperty = NULL,
  WorkerType = NULL,
  NumberOfWorkers = NULL,
  ExecutionClass = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>JobName</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The name of the job definition to use.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>JobRunQueuingEnabled</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies whether job run queuing is enabled for the job run.
</p>
<p>A value of true means job run queuing is enabled for the job run. If
false or not populated, the job run will not be considered for queueing.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>JobRunId</code></td>
<td>
<p>The ID of a previous <code>JobRun</code> to retry.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Arguments</code></td>
<td>
<p>The job arguments associated with this run. For this job run, they
replace the default arguments set in the job definition itself.
</p>
<p>You can specify arguments here that your own job-execution script
consumes, as well as arguments that Glue itself consumes.
</p>
<p>Job arguments may be logged. Do not pass plaintext secrets as arguments.
Retrieve secrets from a Glue Connection, Secrets Manager or other secret
management mechanism if you intend to keep them within the Job.
</p>
<p>For information about how to specify and consume your own Job arguments,
see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-python-calling.html">Calling Glue APIs in Python</a>
topic in the developer guide.

<p>For information about the arguments you can provide to this field when
configuring Spark jobs, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-glue-arguments.html">Special Parameters Used by Glue</a>
topic in the developer guide.

<p>For information about the arguments you can provide to this field when

<td><code>AllocatedCapacity</code></td>
<td>
<p>This field is deprecated. Use <code>MaxCapacity</code> instead.
</p>
<p>The number of Glue data processing units (DPUs) to allocate to this
JobRun. You can allocate a minimum of 2 DPUs; the default is 10. A DPU
is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of
compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/">Glue pricing page</a>.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Timeout</code></td>
<td>
<p>The <code>JobRun</code> timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job run
can consume resources before it is terminated and enters <code>TIMEOUT</code>
status. This value overrides the timeout value set in the parent job.
</p>
<p>Streaming jobs must have timeout values less than 7 days or 10080
minutes. When the value is left blank, the job will be restarted after 7
days based if you have not setup a maintenance window. If you have setup
maintenance window, it will be restarted during the maintenance window
after 7 days.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>MaxCapacity</code></td>
<td>
<p>For Glue version 1.0 or earlier jobs, using the standard worker type,
the number of Glue data processing units (DPUs) that can be allocated
when this job runs. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that
consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more
information, see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/">Glue pricing page</a>.
</p>
<p>For Glue version 2.0+ jobs, you cannot specify a <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠Maximum capacity⁠</code>.
Instead, you should specify a <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠Worker type⁠</code> and the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠Number of workers⁠</code>.
</p>
<p>Do not set <code>MaxCapacity</code> if using <code>WorkerType</code> and <code>NumberOfWorkers</code>.
</p>
<p>The value that can be allocated for <code>MaxCapacity</code> depends on whether you
are running a Python shell job, an Apache Spark ETL job, or an Apache
Spark streaming ETL job:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> When you specify a Python shell job
(<code>JobCommand.Name</code>="pythonshell"), you can allocate either 0.0625 or
1 DPU. The default is 0.0625 DPU.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> When you specify an Apache Spark ETL job
(<code>JobCommand.Name</code>="glueetl") or Apache Spark streaming ETL job
(<code>JobCommand.Name</code>="gluestreaming"), you can allocate from 2 to 100
DPUs. The default is 10 DPUs. This job type cannot have a fractional
DPU allocation.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SecurityConfiguration</code></td>

<p>The name of the <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> structure to be used with this
job run.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>WorkerType</code></td>
<td>
<p>The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a job runs. Accepts
a value of G.1X, G.2X, G.4X, G.8X or G.025X for Spark jobs. Accepts the
value Z.2X for Ray jobs.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> For the <code>G.1X</code> worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPUs, 16
GB of memory) with 84GB disk (approximately 34GB free), and provides
1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for workloads
such as data transforms, joins, and queries, to offers a scalable
and cost effective way to run most jobs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For the <code>G.2X</code> worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPUs, 32
GB of memory) with 128GB disk (approximately 77GB free), and
provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for
workloads such as data transforms, joins, and queries, to offers a
scalable and cost effective way to run most jobs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For the <code>G.4X</code> worker type, each worker maps to 4 DPU (16 vCPUs, 64
GB of memory) with 256GB disk (approximately 235GB free), and
provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for
jobs whose workloads contain your most demanding transforms,
aggregations, joins, and queries. This worker type is available only
for Glue version 3.0 or later Spark ETL jobs in the following Amazon
Web Services Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West
(Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia
Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe
(Ireland), and Europe (Stockholm).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For the <code>G.8X</code> worker type, each worker maps to 8 DPU (32 vCPUs, 128
GB of memory) with 512GB disk (approximately 487GB free), and
provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for
jobs whose workloads contain your most demanding transforms,
aggregations, joins, and queries. This worker type is available only
for Glue version 3.0 or later Spark ETL jobs, in the same Amazon Web
Services Regions as supported for the <code>G.4X</code> worker type.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For the <code>G.025X</code> worker type, each worker maps to 0.25 DPU (2 vCPUs,
4 GB of memory) with 84GB disk (approximately 34GB free), and
provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for
low volume streaming jobs. This worker type is only available for
Glue version 3.0 streaming jobs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For the <code>Z.2X</code> worker type, each worker maps to 2 M-DPU (8vCPUs, 64
GB of memory) with 128 GB disk (approximately 120GB free), and
provides up to 8 Ray workers based on the autoscaler.
</p>
</li>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>NumberOfWorkers</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of workers of a defined <code>workerType</code> that are allocated when
a job runs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ExecutionClass</code></td>
<td>
<p>Indicates whether the job is run with a standard or flexible execution
class. The standard execution-class is ideal for time-sensitive
workloads that require fast job startup and dedicated resources.
</p>
<p>The flexible execution class is appropriate for time-insensitive jobs
whose start and completion times may vary.
</p>
<p>Only jobs with Glue version 3.0 and above and command type <code>glueetl</code>
will be allowed to set <code>ExecutionClass</code> to <code>FLEX</code>. The flexible
execution class is available for Spark jobs.</p>
