<h2> Summarize a phylog.cancor object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A 'method' for objects of class phylog.cancor. Shows the original
data, and provides p-values and quantiles of the canonical
correlations based on the simulated data. There is a print 'method'
for this summary.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To test the hypothesis that all population canonical correlations are
zero we use the likelihood-ratio statistic from Krzanowski (pp. 447
and ff.); this
statistic is computed for the original data set and for each of the
simulated data sets, and we obtain the p-value as  (number of simulated data sets
with LR statistic larger than original (”real”) data + 1) / (number of simulated
data sets + 1).  Note that a test of this same hypothesis using the
Union-Intersection approach is equivalent to the test we implement
below for the first canonical correlation.
</p>
<p>The p-values for the individual canonical correlations are calculated in two different ways. For the 'component-wise'
ones the p-value for a particular correlation is
(number of simulated data sets
with canonical correlation larger than original (”real”) data + 1) / (number of simulated
data sets + 1). With this approach, you can find that the p-value for,
say, the second canonical correlation is smaller than the first, which
is not sensible. It only makes sense to examine the second
canonical correlation if the first one is ”significant”, etc. Thus,
when considering the significance of the second canonical correlation
we should account for the value of the first. In other words, there is only
support against the null hypothesis (of no singificant second
canonical correlation) if both the first and the second canonical
correlations from the observed data set are larger than most of the
simulated data sets. We can account for what happens with
the first canonical correlation by computing the p-value of the second
canonical correlation as the number of simulations in which the second
simulated canonical correlation is larger than the observed, or the
first simulated canonical correlation is larger than the observed one,
or both (so that the only cases that count agains the null are those
where both the first ans second canonical correlations are smaller
than the observed ones); these we call 'Multiple' p-values.

<h3>WARNING</h3>

<p>It is
necessary to be careful with the null hypothesis you are testing and
how the null data set —the simulations— are generated. For
instance, suppose you want to examine the canonical correlations
between sets x and y; you will probably want to generate x and y each
with the observed correlations within each set so that the
correlations within each set are maintained (but with no
correlations among sets). You probably do not want to generate each of
the x's as if they were independent of each other x, and ditto for y, since
that will destroy the correlations within each set; see some
discussion in Manly, 1997.
