<h2>  Calculate McDonald's  omega estimates of general and total factor saturation </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>McDonald has proposed coefficient omega as an estimate of the general factor saturation of a test.  One way to find omega is to do a factor analysis of the original data set, rotate the factors obliquely, do a Schmid Leiman transformation, and then find omega. This function estimates omega as suggested by McDonald by using hierarchical factor analysis (following Jensen). A related option is to define the model using omega and then perform a confirmatory (bi-factor) analysis using the sem or lavaan packages.  This is done by omegaSem and omegaFromSem. omegaFromSem will convert appropriate sem/lavaan objects to find omega.  Yet another option is to do the direct Schmid-Leiman of Waller.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>“Many scales are assumed by their developers and users to be primarily a measure of one latent variable. When it is also assumed that the scale conforms to the effect indicator model of measurement (as is almost always the case in psychological assessment), it is important to support such an 
interpretation with evidence regarding the internal structure of that scale. In particular, it is important to examine two related properties pertaining to the internal structure of such a scale. The first property relates to whether all the indicators forming the scale measure a latent variable in common. 
</p>
<p>The second internal structural property pertains to the proportion of variance in the scale scores (derived from summing or averaging the indicators) accounted for by this latent variable that is common to all the indicators (Cronbach, 1951; McDonald, 1999; Revelle, 1979). That is, if an effect indicator scale is primarily a measure of one latent variable common to all the indicators forming the scale, then that latent variable should account for the majority of the variance in the scale scores. Put differently, this variance ratio provides important information about the sampling fluctuations when estimating individuals' standing on a latent variable common to all the indicators arising from the sampling of indicators (i.e., when dealing with either Type 2 or Type 12 sampling, to use the terminology of Lord, 1956). That is, this variance proportion can be interpreted as the square of the correlation between the scale score and the latent variable common to all the indicators in the infinite universe of indicators of which the scale indicators are a subset. Put yet another way, this variance ratio is important both as reliability and a validity coefficient. This is a reliability issue as the larger this variance ratio is, the more accurately one can predict an individual's relative standing on the latent variable common to all the scale's indicators based on his or her 
observed scale score. At the same time, this variance ratio also bears on the construct validity of the scale given that construct validity encompasses the internal structure of a scale." (Zinbarg, Yovel, Revelle, and McDonald, 2006).
</p>
<p>McDonald has proposed coefficient omega_hierarchical (<code class="reqn">\omega_h</code>) as an estimate of the general factor saturation of a test.  Zinbarg, Revelle, Yovel and Li (2005) 
<a href="https://personality-project.org/revelle/publications/zinbarg.revelle.pmet.05.pdf">https://personality-project.org/revelle/publications/zinbarg.revelle.pmet.05.pdf</a> compare McDonald's <code class="reqn">\omega_h</code> to Cronbach's <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> and Revelle's <code class="reqn">\beta</code>.  They conclude that <code class="reqn">\omega_h</code> is the best estimate. (See also Zinbarg et al., 2006 and Revelle and Zinbarg (2009)).   
</p>
<p>One way to find <code class="reqn">\omega_h</code> is to do a factor analysis of the original data set, rotate the factors obliquely, factor that correlation matrix, do a   Schmid-Leiman (schmid) transformation to find general factor loadings, and then find <code class="reqn">\omega_h</code>.  Here we present code to do that.  
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">\omega_h</code> differs as a function of how the factors are estimated.  Four options are available, three use the <code>fa</code> function but with different factoring methods: the default does a minres factor solution, fm="pa"  does a principle axes factor analysis  fm="mle" does a maximum likelihood solution; fm="pc" does a principal components analysis using (<code>principal</code>).  
</p>
<p>For ability items, it is typically the case that all items will have positive loadings on the general factor.  However, for non-cognitive items it is frequently the case that some items are to be scored positively, and some negatively.  Although probably better to specify which directions the items are to be scored by specifying a key vector, if flip =TRUE (the default), items will be reversed so that they have positive loadings on the general factor.  The keys are reported so that scores can be found using the <code>scoreItems</code> function.  Arbitrarily reversing items this way can overestimate the general factor. (See the example with a simulated circumplex).
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">\beta</code>, an alternative to <code class="reqn">\omega_h</code>, is defined as the worst split half 
reliability (Revelle, 1979).  It can be estimated by using <code>ICLUST</code> (a 
hierarchical clustering algorithm originally developed for main frames and written in 
Fortran and that is now part of the psych package.  (For a very complimentary review of 
why the ICLUST algorithm is useful in scale construction, see Cooksey and Soutar, 2005)). 
</p>
<p>The <code>omega</code> function uses exploratory factor analysis to estimate the <code class="reqn">\omega_h</code> coefficient.  It is important to remember that  “A recommendation that should be heeded, regardless of the method chosen to estimate <code class="reqn">\omega_h</code>, is to always examine the pattern of the estimated general factor loadings prior to estimating <code class="reqn">\omega_h</code>. Such an examination constitutes an informal test of the assumption that there is a latent variable common to all of the scale's indicators that can be conducted even in the context of EFA. If the loadings were salient for only a relatively small subset of the indicators, this would suggest that there is no true general factor underlying the covariance matrix. Just such an informal assumption test would have afforded a great deal of protection against the possibility of misinterpreting the misleading <code class="reqn">\omega_h</code> estimates occasionally produced in the simulations reported here." (Zinbarg et al., 2006, p 137).
</p>
<p>A simple demonstration of the problem of an omega estimate reflecting just one of two group factors can be found in the last example.  
</p>
<p>Diagnostic statistics that reflect the quality of the omega solution include a comparison of the relative size of the g factor eigen value to the other eigen values, the percent of the common variance for each item that is general factor variance (p2), the mean of p2, and the standard deviation of p2.  Further diagnostics can be done by describing (describe) the $schmid$sl results.
</p>
<p>Although omega_h is uniquely defined only for cases where 3 or more subfactors are extracted, it is sometimes desired to have a two factor solution.  By default this is done by forcing the schmid extraction to treat the two subfactors as having equal loadings.  
</p>
<p>There are three possible options for this condition: setting the general factor loadings between the two lower order factors to be "equal" which will be the sqrt(oblique correlations between the factors) or to "first" or "second" in which case the general factor is equated with either the first or second group factor. A  message is issued suggesting that the model is not really well defined. This solution discussed in Zinbarg et al., 2007.  To do this in omega, add the option="first" or option="second" to the call.
</p>
<p>Although obviously not meaningful for a 1 factor solution, it is of course possible to find the sum of the loadings on the first (and only) factor, square them, and compare them to the overall matrix variance.  This is done, with appropriate complaints.
</p>
<p>In addition to <code class="reqn">\omega_h</code>, another of McDonald's coefficients is <code class="reqn">\omega_t</code>.  This is an estimate of the total reliability of a test. 
</p>
<p>McDonald's <code class="reqn">\omega_t</code>, which is similar to Guttman's <code class="reqn">\lambda_6</code>, <code>guttman</code> but uses the estimates of uniqueness (<code class="reqn">u^2</code>) from factor analysis to find <code class="reqn">e_j^2</code>. This is based on a decomposition of the variance of a test score, <code class="reqn">V_x</code>  into four parts: that due to a general factor, <code class="reqn">\vec{g}</code>, that due to a set of group factors, <code class="reqn">\vec{f}</code>,  (factors common to some but not all of the items), specific factors, <code class="reqn">\vec{s}</code> unique to each item, and <code class="reqn">\vec{e}</code>, random error.  (Because specific variance can not be distinguished from random error unless the test is given at least twice,  some combine these both into error). 
</p>
<p>Letting <code class="reqn">\vec{x} =  \vec{cg} + \vec{Af} + \vec {Ds} + \vec{e}</code>
then the communality of item<code class="reqn">_j</code>, based upon general as well as group factors,
<code class="reqn">h_j^2 = c_j^2 + \sum{f_{ij}^2}</code>
and the unique variance for the item
<code class="reqn">u_j^2 = \sigma_j^2 (1-h_j^2)</code>
may be used to estimate the test reliability.
That is, if <code class="reqn">h_j^2</code> is the communality of item<code class="reqn">_j</code>, based upon general as well as group factors,  then for standardized items,  <code class="reqn">e_j^2 = 1 - h_j^2</code> and
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
\omega_t = \frac{\vec{1}\vec{cc'}\vec{1} + \vec{1}\vec{AA'}\vec{1}'}{V_x} = 1 - \frac{\sum(1-h_j^2)}{V_x} = 1 - \frac{\sum u^2}{V_x}</code>
</p>

<p>Because <code class="reqn">h_j^2 \geq r_{smc}^2</code>, <code class="reqn">\omega_t \geq \lambda_6</code>.
</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish here between the two <code class="reqn">\omega</code> coefficients of McDonald, 1978 and Equation 6.20a of McDonald, 1999, <code class="reqn">\omega_t</code> and <code class="reqn">\omega_h</code>.  While the former is based upon the sum of squared loadings on all the factors, the latter is based upon the sum of the squared loadings on the general factor. 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\omega_h = \frac{ \vec{1}\vec{cc'}\vec{1}}{V_x}</code>
</p>

<p>Another estimate reported is the omega for an infinite length test with a structure similar to the observed test (omega H asymptotic).  This is found by 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\omega_{limit} = \frac{\vec{1}\vec{cc'}\vec{1}}{\vec{1}\vec{cc'}\vec{1} + \vec{1}\vec{AA'}\vec{1}'}</code>
</p>
<p>. 
</p>
<p>Following suggestions by Steve Reise, the Explained Common Variance (ECV) is also reported.  This is the ratio of the general factor eigen value to the sum of all of the eigen values.  As such, it is a better indicator of unidimensionality than of the amount of test variance accounted for by a general factor.
</p>
<p>The input to omega may be a correlation matrix or a raw data matrix, or a factor pattern matrix with the factor intercorrelations (Phi) matrix.  
</p>
<p><code>omega</code> is an exploratory factor analysis function that uses a Schmid-Leiman transformation.  <code>omegaSem</code> first calls <code>omega</code> and then takes the Schmid-Leiman solution, converts this to a confirmatory sem model and then calls the sem package to conduct a confirmatory model.  <code class="reqn">\omega_h</code> is then calculated from the CFA output. Although for well behaved problems, the efa and cfa solutions will be practically identical, the CFA solution will not always agree with the EFA solution. In particular, the estimated   <code class="reqn">R^2</code> will sometimes exceed 1. (An example of this is the Harman 24 cognitive abilities problem.)
</p>
<p>In addition, not all EFA solutions will produce workable CFA solutions.  Model misspecifications will lead to very strange CFA estimates. 
</p>
<p>It is also possible to give <code>omega</code> a factor pattern matrix and the associated factor intercorrelation.  In this case, the analysis will be done on these matrices.  This is particularly useful if one is not satisfied with the exploratory EFA solutions and rotation options and somehow comes up with an alternative. (For instance, one might want to do a EFA using fm='pa' with a Kaiser normalized Promax solution with a specified m value.)  
</p>
<p><code>omegaFromSem</code> takes the output from a sem model and uses it to find 
<code class="reqn">\omega_h</code>.  The estimate of factor indeterminacy, found by the multiple <code class="reqn">R^2</code> of the variables with the factors, will not match that found by the EFA model.  In particular, the estimated   <code class="reqn">R^2</code> will sometimes exceed 1. (An example of this is the Harman 24 cognitive abilities problem.)
</p>
<p>The notion of omega may be applied to the individual factors as well as the overall test. A typical use of omega is to identify subscales of a total inventory.  Some of that variability is due to the general factor of the inventory, some to the specific variance of each subscale.  Thus, we can find a number of different omega estimates:   what percentage of the variance of the items identified with each subfactor is actually due to the general factor.  What variance is common but unique to the subfactor, and what is the total reliable variance of each subfactor.   These results are reported in omega.group object and in the last few lines of the normal output.
</p>
<p>Finally, and still being tested, is <code>omegaDirect</code> adapted from Waller (2017).  This is a direct rotation to a Schmid-Leiman  like solution without doing the hierarchical factoring (<code>directSl</code>).  This rotation is then interpreted in terms of omega.  It is included here to allow for comparisons with the alternative procedures <code>omega</code> and <code>omegaSem</code>.  Preliminary analyses suggests that it produces inappropriate solutions for the case where there is no general factor.
</p>
<p>Moral: Finding omega_h is tricky and one should probably compare <code>omega</code>, <code>omegaSem</code>,  <code>omegaDirect</code> and even <code>iclust</code> solutions to understand the differences.
</p>
<p>The summary of the omega object is a reduced set of the most useful output.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Requires the GPArotation package.
</p>
<p>The default rotation uses oblimin from the GPArotation package.  Alternatives include the simplimax function, as well as <code>Promax</code> or the <code>promax</code> rotations.  promax will do a Kaiser normalization before applying Promax rotation.
</p>
<p>If the factor solution leads to an exactly orthogonal solution (probably only for demonstration data sets), then use the rotate="Promax" option to get a solution.
</p>
<p><code>omegaSem</code> requires the sem or lavaan packages.  <code>omegaFromSem</code> uses the output from the sem or lavaan package.
</p>
<p><code>omega</code> may be run on raw data (finding either  Pearson or  tetrachoric/polychoric corrlations, depending upon the poly option) a correlation matrix, a polychoric correlation matrix (found by e.g., <code>polychoric</code>), or the output of a previous omega run.  This last case is particularly useful when working with categorical data using the poly=TRUE option.  For in this case, most of the time is spent in finding the correlation matrix.  The matrix is saved as part of the omega output and may be used as input for subsequent runs.  A similar feature is found in <code>irt.fa</code> where the output of one analysis can be taken as the input to the subsequent analyses.  
</p>
<p>However, simulations based upon tetrachoric and polychoric correlations suggest that although the structure is better defined, that the estimates of omega are inflated over the true general factor saturation.
</p>
<p>Omega returns factor scores based upon the Schmid-Leiman transformation.  To get the hierarchical factor scores, it is necessary to do this outside of omega. See the example (not run).
</p>
<p>Consider the case of the raw data in an object data.  Then 
</p>
<p>f3 &lt;- fa(data,3,scores="tenBerge", oblique.rotation=TRUE
f1 &lt;- fa(f3$scores)
hier.scores &lt;- data.frame(f1$scores,f3$scores)
</p>
<p>When doing fm="pc", principal components are done for the original correlation matrix, but minres is used when examining the intercomponent correlations.   A warning is issued that the method was changed to minres for the higher order solution.  omega is a factor model, and finding loadings using principal components will overestimate the resulting solution.  This is particularly problematic for the amount of group saturation, and thus the omega.group statistics are overestimates.  
</p>
<p>The last three lines of omega report "Total, General and Subset omega for each subset".  These are available as the omega.group object in the output.
</p>
<p>The last of these (omega group)  is effectively what Steve Reise calls omegaS for the subset omega.
</p>
<p>The omega general is the amount of variance in the group that is accounted for by the general factor, the omega total is the amount of variance in the group accounted for by general + group.
</p>
<p>This is based upon a cluster solution (that is to say, every item is assigned to one group) and this is why for  first column the omega general and group do not add up to omega total.  Some of the variance is found in the cross loadings between groups.
</p>
<p>Reise and others like to report the ratio of the second line to the first line (what portion of the reliable variance is general factor) and the third row to the first (what portion of the reliable variance is within group but not general.  This may be found by using the omega.group object that is returned by omega. (See the last example.)
</p>
<p>If using the lavaan=TRUE option in <code>omegaSem</code> please note that variable names can not start with a digit (e.g. 4.Letter.Words in the  <code>Thurstone</code> data set. The leading digit needs to be removed. 
</p>
<p><code>omegaSem</code> will do an exploratory efa and omega, create (and return) the commands for doing either a sem or lavaan analysis.  The commands are returned as the model object.  This can be used for further sem/lavaan analyses.  
</p>
<p>Omega can also be found from  an analysis  done using lavaan or sem directly by calling  <code>omegaFromSem</code> with the original correlation matrix and the fit of the sem/lavaan model.  See the last (not run) example)
