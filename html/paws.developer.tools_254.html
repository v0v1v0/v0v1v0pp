<h2>Deploys an application revision through the specified deployment group</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Deploys an application revision through the specified deployment group.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/codedeploy_create_deployment/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/codedeploy_create_deployment/</a> for full documentation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">codedeploy_create_deployment(
  applicationName,
  deploymentGroupName = NULL,
  revision = NULL,
  deploymentConfigName = NULL,
  description = NULL,
  ignoreApplicationStopFailures = NULL,
  targetInstances = NULL,
  autoRollbackConfiguration = NULL,
  updateOutdatedInstancesOnly = NULL,
  fileExistsBehavior = NULL,
  overrideAlarmConfiguration = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>applicationName</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The name of an CodeDeploy application associated with the user or Amazon
Web Services account.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>deploymentGroupName</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the deployment group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>revision</code></td>
<td>
<p>The type and location of the revision to deploy.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>deploymentConfigName</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of a deployment configuration associated with the user or
Amazon Web Services account.
</p>
<p>If not specified, the value configured in the deployment group is used
as the default. If the deployment group does not have a deployment
configuration associated with it, <code>CodeDeployDefault</code>.<code>OneAtATime</code> is
used by default.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>description</code></td>
<td>
<p>A comment about the deployment.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ignoreApplicationStopFailures</code></td>
<td>
<p>If true, then if an <code>ApplicationStop</code>, <code>BeforeBlockTraffic</code>, or
<code>AfterBlockTraffic</code> deployment lifecycle event to an instance fails,
then the deployment continues to the next deployment lifecycle event.
For example, if <code>ApplicationStop</code> fails, the deployment continues with
<code>DownloadBundle</code>. If <code>BeforeBlockTraffic</code> fails, the deployment
continues with <code>BlockTraffic</code>. If <code>AfterBlockTraffic</code> fails, the
deployment continues with <code>ApplicationStop</code>.
</p>
<p>If false or not specified, then if a lifecycle event fails during a
deployment to an instance, that deployment fails. If deployment to that
instance is part of an overall deployment and the number of healthy
hosts is not less than the minimum number of healthy hosts, then a
deployment to the next instance is attempted.
</p>
<p>During a deployment, the CodeDeploy agent runs the scripts specified for
<code>ApplicationStop</code>, <code>BeforeBlockTraffic</code>, and <code>AfterBlockTraffic</code> in the
AppSpec file from the previous successful deployment. (All other scripts
are run from the AppSpec file in the current deployment.) If one of
these scripts contains an error and does not run successfully, the
deployment can fail.
</p>
<p>If the cause of the failure is a script from the last successful
deployment that will never run successfully, create a new deployment and
use <code>ignoreApplicationStopFailures</code> to specify that the
<code>ApplicationStop</code>, <code>BeforeBlockTraffic</code>, and <code>AfterBlockTraffic</code>
failures should be ignored.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>targetInstances</code></td>
<td>
<p>Information about the instances that belong to the replacement
environment in a blue/green deployment.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>autoRollbackConfiguration</code></td>
<td>
<p>Configuration information for an automatic rollback that is added when a
deployment is created.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>updateOutdatedInstancesOnly</code></td>
<td>
<p>Indicates whether to deploy to all instances or only to instances that
are not running the latest application revision.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fileExistsBehavior</code></td>
<td>
<p>Information about how CodeDeploy handles files that already exist in a
deployment target location but weren't part of the previous successful
deployment.
</p>
<p>The <code>fileExistsBehavior</code> parameter takes any of the following values:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> DISALLOW: The deployment fails. This is also the default behavior if
no option is specified.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> OVERWRITE: The version of the file from the application revision
currently being deployed replaces the version already on the
instance.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> RETAIN: The version of the file already on the instance is kept and
used as part of the new deployment.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overrideAlarmConfiguration</code></td>
<td>
<p>Allows you to specify information about alarms associated with a
deployment. The alarm configuration that you specify here will override
the alarm configuration at the deployment group level. Consider
overriding the alarm configuration if you have set up alarms at the
deployment group level that are causing deployment failures. In this
case, you would call <code>create_deployment</code>
to create a new deployment that uses a previous application revision
that is known to work, and set its alarm configuration to turn off alarm
polling. Turning off alarm polling ensures that the new deployment
proceeds without being blocked by the alarm that was generated by the
previous, failed, deployment.
</p>
<p>If you specify an <code>overrideAlarmConfiguration</code>, you need the
<code>update_deployment_group</code> IAM
permission when calling
<code>create_deployment</code>.</p>
