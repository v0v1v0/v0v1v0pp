<h2>Implementation of the Potential Model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides functions to compute the potential model as
defined by Stewart (1941) &lt;doi:10.1126/science.93.2404.89&gt;. Several options
are available to customize the model, such as the possibility to fine-tune
the distance friction functions or to use custom distance matrices. Some
computations are parallelized to improve their efficiency.
