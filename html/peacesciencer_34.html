<h2>A directed dyad-year data frame of Correlates of War state system members</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a complete directed dyad-year data frame of Correlates of War
state system members. I offer it here as a shortcut for various other functions when
I am working on new additions and don't want to invest time in waiting for
<code>create_dyadyears()</code> to run. As a general rule, this data frame is
updated after every calendar year to include the most recently concluded
calendar year.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cow_ddy
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>ccode1</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector for the Correlates of War state code for the first state</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ccode2</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector for the Correlates of War state code for the second state</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>year</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector for the year</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data are a quick generation from the <code>create_dyadyears()</code> function in this package.
