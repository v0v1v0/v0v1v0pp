<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The co-moments, including covariance, coskewness, and cokurtosis, do not
allow the marginal impact of an asset on a portfolio to be directly
measured.  Instead, Martellini and Zieman (2007) develop a framework that
assesses the potential diversification of an asset relative to a portfolio.
They use higher moment betas to estimate how much portfolio risk will be
impacted by adding an asset, in terms of symmetric risk (i.e., volatility),
in asymmetry risk (i.e., skewness), and extreme risks (i.e. kurtosis). That
allows them to show that adding an asset to a portfolio (or benchmark) will
reduce the portfolio's variance to be reduced if the second-order beta of
the asset with respect to the portfolio is less than one.  They develop the
same concepts for the third and fourth order moments.  The authors offer
these higher moment betas as a measure of the diversification potential of
an asset.
</p>
<p>Higher moment betas are defined as proportional to the derivative of the
covariance, coskewness and cokurtosis of the second, third and fourth
portfolio moment with respect to the portfolio weights. The beta co-variance
is calculated as: 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn"> BetaCoV(Ra,Rb) = \beta^{(2)}_{a,b} =
\frac{CoV(R_a,R_b)}{\mu^{(2)}(R_b)} </code>
</p>
 
<p>Beta co-skewness is given as: 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn"> BetaCoS(Ra,Rb) = \beta^{(3)}_{a,b}= \frac{CoS(R_a,R_b)}{\mu^{(3)}(R_b)} </code>
</p>
 
<p>Beta co-kurtosis is: 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn"> BetaCoK(Ra,Rb)=\beta^{(4)}_{a,b}
= \frac{CoK(R_a,R_b)}{\mu^{(4)}(R_b)} </code>
</p>
 
<p>where the <code class="reqn">n</code>-th centered moment is
calculated as 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn"> \mu^{(n)}(R) = E\lbrack(R-E(R))^n\rbrack </code>
</p>

<p>A beta is greater than one indicates that no diversification benefits should
be expected from the introduction of that asset into the portfolio.
Conversely, a beta that is less than one indicates that adding the new asset
should reduce the resulting portfolio's volatility and kurtosis, and to an
increase in skewness. More specifically, the lower the beta the higher the
diversification effect on normal risk (i.e. volatility). Similarly, since
extreme risks are generally characterised by negative skewness and positive
kurtosis, the lower the beta, the higher the diversification effect on
extreme risks (as reflected in Modified Value-at-Risk or ER).
</p>
<p>The addition of a small fraction of a new asset to a portfolio leads to a
decrease in the portfolio's second moment (respectively, an increase in the
portfolio's third moment and a decrease in the portfolio's fourth moment) if
and only if the second moment (respectively, the third moment and fourth
moment) beta is less than one (see Martellini and Ziemann (2007) for more
details).
</p>
<p>For skewness, the interpretation is slightly more involved.  If the skewness
of the portfolio is negative, we would expect an increase in portfolio
skewness when the third moment beta is lower than one. When the skewness of
the portfolio is positive, then the condition is that the third moment beta
is greater than, as opposed to lower than, one.
</p>
<p>Because the interpretation of beta coskewness is made difficult by the need
to condition on it's skewness, we deviate from the more widely used measure
slightly.  To make the interpretation consistent across all three measures,
the beta coskewness function tests the skewness and multiplies the result by
the sign of the skewness.  That allows an analyst to review the metric and
interpret it without needing additional information.  To use the more widely
used metric, simply set the parameter <code>test = FALSE</code>.
