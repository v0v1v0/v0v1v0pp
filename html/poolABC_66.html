<h2>Run scrm and obtain genotypes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function will run the scrm package, according to the command line
supplied as input. It will also combine haplotypes into genotypes and
re-organize the output if the simulations were performed under a single
origin scenario. This is to ensure that the output of the four-population
models will always follow the same order: the two divergent ecotypes in the
first location, followed by the two divergent ecotypes in the second
location.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">runSCRM(commands, nDip, nPops, model)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>commands</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string containing the commands for the scrm
package. This string can be created using the <code>cmd2pops</code>, the <code>cmdSingle</code>
or the <code>cmdParallel</code> functions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nDip</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer representing the total number of diploid individuals
to simulate. Note that scrm actually simulates haplotypes, so the number of
simulated haplotypes is double of this.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nPops</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer that informs of how many populations exist on the
model you are trying to run.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either "2pops", "Single" or "Parallel" indicating which model
should be simulated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list with the simulated genotypes. Each entry is a different locus
and, for each locus, different rows represent different individuals and
each column is a different site.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># create a vector with parameter values for a two populations model
params &lt;- createParams(Nref = c(25000, 25000), ratio = c(0.1, 3), pool = c(5, 250),
seq = c(0.0001, 0.001), split = c(0, 3), CW = c(1e-13, 1e-3), WC = c(1e-13, 1e-3),
bT = c(0, 0.2), model = "2pops")

# create the command line for the scrm package
cmds &lt;- cmd2pops(parameters = params, nSites = 2000, nLoci = 10, nDip = 100, mutrate = 2e-8)

# run SCRM and obtain the genotypes
runSCRM(commands = cmds, nDip = 100, nPops = 2, model = "2pops")
