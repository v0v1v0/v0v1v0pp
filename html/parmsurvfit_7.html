<h2>Data on time until actors receive their first Academy Award nomination</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

The data for the first film appearance and for the first Oscar nomination was taken from IMDb.
It should be noted that of the 128 observations in the data set, 48 were right-censored. Right-censored
observations represent actors who have not received an Oscar nomination by the year 2017 or actors that
died before 2017 without ever receiving an Oscar nomination. For the censor variable "1" represents complete
observations, actors who received an Oscar nomination by the year 2017, and "0" represents right-censored
