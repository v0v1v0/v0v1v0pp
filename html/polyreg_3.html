<h2>
Silicon Valley programmers and engineers data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set is adapted from the 2000 Census (5% sample, person
records).  It is mainly restricted to programmers and engineers in the 
Silicon Valley area.  (Apparently due to errors, there are some from
other ZIP codes.)
</p>
<p>Has columns for age, education, occupation, gender, wage income and
weeks worked.  The education column has been collapsed to Master's
degree, PhD and other.
</p>
<p>The variable codes, e.g. occupational codes, are available from
<a href="https://usa.ipums.org/usa/volii/occ2000.shtml">https://usa.ipums.org/usa/volii/occ2000.shtml</a>.
(Short code lists are given in the record layout, but longer ones are in
the appendix Code Lists.)
