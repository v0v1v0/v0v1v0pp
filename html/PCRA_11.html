<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The term "factor exposures" is often used for the values of the 14 factors,
which SPGMI also refers to as "scores" or "alpha factors". 
Our names for the the 14 factors are identical to those used by SPGMI in
their AFL library.  For an introduction to the AFL library see:
<a href="https://www.marketplace.spglobal.com/en/datasets/alpha-factor-library-(3)">https://www.marketplace.spglobal.com/en/datasets/alpha-factor-library-(3)</a>
</p>
<p>The four CapGroupLast categorizations of the stocks were determined using the
three capitalization breakpoints $xxxM, $yyyM, $zzzM. Details concerning the
construction of the monthly CapGroup categorizations will eventually be
provided in a Vignette.
</p>
<p>The factorsSPGMI data contains stocks in 8 of the 11 GICS sectors, with no

Sector, followed by the GICS sector name:
