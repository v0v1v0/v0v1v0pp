<h2>The pulsar package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Graphical model selection with the pulsar package
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package provides methods to select a sparse, undirected graphical model by choosing a penalty parameter (lambda or <code class="reqn">\lambda</code>) among a list of ordered values of lambda. We use an implementation of the Stability Approach to Regularization Selection (StARS, see references) inspired by the <span class="pkg">huge</span> package.
</p>
<p>However, <span class="pkg">pulsar</span> includes some major differences from other R packages for graphical model estimation and selection (<span class="pkg">glasso</span>, <span class="pkg">huge</span>, <span class="pkg">QUIC</span>, <span class="pkg">XMRF</span>, <span class="pkg">clime</span>, <span class="pkg">flare</span>, etc). The underlying graphical model is computed by passing a function as an argument to <code>pulsar</code>. Thus, any algorithm for penalized graphical models can be used in this framework (see <code>pulsar-function</code> for more details), including those from the above packages. <span class="pkg">pulsar</span> brings computational experiments under one roof by separating subsampling and calculation of summary criteria from the user-specified core model. The typical workflow in <span class="pkg">pulsar</span> is to perform subsampling first (via the <code>pulsar</code>) and then refit the model on the full dataset using <code>refit</code>.
</p>
<p>Previous StARS implementations can be inefficient for large graphs or when many subsamples are required. <code>pulsar</code> can compute upper and lower bounds on the regularization path for the StARS criterion after only <code class="reqn">2</code> subsamples which makes it possible to neglect lambda values that are far from the desired StARS regularization parameter, reducing computation time for the rest of the <code class="reqn">N-2</code> subsamples (Bounded StARS (B-StARS)).
</p>
<p>We also implement additional subsampling-based graph summary criteria which can be used for more informed model selection. For example, we have shown that induced subgraph (graphlet) stability (G-StARS) improves empirical performance over StARS but other criteria are also offered.
</p>
<p>Subsampling amounts to running the specified core model for <code class="reqn">N</code> independent computations. Using the <span class="pkg">batchtools</span> framework, we provide a simple wrapper, <code>batch.pulsar</code>, for running <code>pulsar</code> in embarrassingly parallel mode in an hpc environment. Summary criteria are computed using a Map/Reduce strategy, which lowers memory footprint for large models.
