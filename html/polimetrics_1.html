<h2>Calculating Geographical Diffusion</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculating Geographical Diffusion
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">geog.diffuse(df, id, neighbors, time, status, end = FALSE, keep = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>data frame to read in. Data frame should include a variable that is a character list of each observation's neighbors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>id</code></td>
<td>
<p>the grouping variable, usually states or counties</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>neighbors</code></td>
<td>
<p>a variable that is a <code>character</code> list of each observation's neighbors. The elements of the character list of neighbors should be separated by commas.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time</code></td>
<td>
<p>the time variable, at which observations are measured.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>status</code></td>
<td>
<p>binary, user-defined measure of the status of policy or event in a state in a given year. <code>0</code> equates to <em>policy has not yet occurred in the year, for the state</em>, <code>1</code> equates to <em>policy event has already been adopted in the year, for the state</em> â€“ a value of <code>1</code> should exist for a state in the year it was adopted and every year thereafter). The example below relies on ERA ratification data from Soule and King (2006) &lt;doi:10.1086/499908&gt;, merged with ideology data from Berry et al. (1998) &lt;doi:10.2307/2991759&gt;, but the user should include the measure of adoption of their choice.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>end</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical (default set to <code>F</code>). When set to <code>end = T</code>, will calculate the percent of neighbors that had adopted policy by year-end. Otherwise, will calculate based on number of neighbors that had adopted the policy at year-start.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical (default set to <code>F</code>). When set to <code>end = T</code>, will include additional variables (<em>number of neighbors</em> and <em>number of neighbors that had adopted the policy</em>) in the updated data frame.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function updates the data frame with a new variable capturing the geographical diffusion score.

<p>This function calculates the percent (or proportion) of geographically contiguous neighbors that have engaged in some <em>event</em> (e.g. policy adoption) in a given year. This function can be applied to any unit of analysis and time level for any type of event.
