<h2>Graphical Model 5-Dim Binary Example Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set contains a matrix containing information on five binary
variables (coded as 0/1) and the corresonding DAG model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(gmB)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The format is a list of two components
</p>

<dl>
<dt>x:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Int [1:5000, 1:5] 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 ...</p>
</dd>
<dt>g:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Formal class 'graphNEL' [package "graph"] with 6 slots<br>
.. ..@ nodes     : chr [1:5] "1" "2" "3" "4" ...<br>
.. ..@ edgeL     :List of 5<br>
........      
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data was generated using Tetrad in the following way. A random DAG
on five nodes was generated; binary variables were assigned to each
node; then conditional probability tables corresponding
to the structure of the generated DAG were constructed. Finally, 5000
samples were drawn using the conditional probability tables.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(gmB)
## maybe str(gmB) ; plot(gmB) ...
</code></pre>
