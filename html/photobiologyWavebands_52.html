<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The mathematical formulation included by Flint and Caldwell (2003)
as an appendix is used. While this formulation is consistently used, the
range of wavelengths over which it has been applied has varied. We use the
approach of the NSF UV network and extrapolate up to 390 nm. The widely
used simulation program TUV uses, instead, 366 nm as the boundary, which
makes a significant difference to the computed irradiance values in sunlight.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a waveband object wavelength defining wavelength range, weighting
function and normalization wavelength.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>In the original publication [1], the long-end wavelength boundary is
not specified. The longest wavelength at which the plant response was
measured is 366 nm. From the data there is no evidence that action would
immediately drop to zero at longer wavelengths. We have used in earlier
versions the same value as used by the 'NSF Polar Programs UV Monitoring
Network' as described in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220130091146/http://uv.biospherical.com/Version2/description-Version2-Database3.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20220130091146/http://uv.biospherical.com/Version2/description-Version2-Database3.html</a>.
</p>
<p>We use 390 nm as default value for <code>w.high</code>, but make if possible for
the user to set a different wavelength. To reproduce the output of the TUV
simulation model [3] version 5.0 set <code>w.high = 366</code>. The effect on the
RAF and doses of changing this wavelength boundary is substantial, as
discussed by Micheletti et al. [2]. Consequently, the value used must be
always reported to ensure reproducibility. For comparisons with previous
reports one may need to recompute effective irradiances using matching
wavelength boundaries on a case by case basis.
