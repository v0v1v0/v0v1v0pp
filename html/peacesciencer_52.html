<h2>Create leader-years from leader data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>create_leaderyears()</code> allows you to generate leader-year
data from leader-level data provided in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">create_leaderyears(system = "archigos", standardize = "none", subset_years)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>system</code></td>
<td>
<p>a leader system with which to create leader-years.
Right now, only "archigos" is supported.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>standardize</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector of length one: "cow", "gw", or "none".
If "cow", the function standardizes the leader-years to just those that
overlap  with state system membership in the Correlates of War state
system (see: <code>cow_states</code>). If "gw", the function standardizes the
leader-years to just those that overlap with the state system dates of
the Gleditsch-Ward date (see: <code>gw_states</code>). If "none", the function
returns all leader-years as presented in Archigos (which is nominally
denominated in Gleditsch-Ward state system codes, if not necessarily
Gleditsch-Ward state system dates). Default is "none".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subset_years</code></td>
<td>
<p>and optional character vector for subsetting the years
returned to just some temporal domain of interest to the user. For example,
<code>c(2000:2005)</code> would subset the data to just all leader-years in 2000, 2001,
2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 Be advised that it's easiest to subset the data after
the full universe of leader-year data have been created. It is also agnostic
about what was supplied to the <code>standardize</code> argument.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>create_leaderyears()</code>, as of writing, only supports the
Archigos data set of leaders.
</p>
<p>Many leader ages are known with precision. Many are not recorded in the
Archigos data. Knowing well that years are aggregates of days, the leader
age variable that gets returned in this output should be treated as an
approximation of the leader's age.
</p>
<p>Be mindful that leader tenure is calculated <em>before</em> any standardization
argument. Archigos has some leader entries that precede the state system
entry for the state, or otherwise do not coincide with state system dates.
For example, Lynden Pindling was in his seventh year as leader of The
Bahamas (in various titles) before independence in 1973 (in which he became
prime minister). Leader tenure is not tethered to state system dates in
situations like this (only the dates recorded in the Archigos data).
</p>
<p>The leader tenure variable returned here does have the odd effect of
potentially misstating leader tenure, or at least making it seem unusual.
For example, Jimmy Carter (<code>USA-1877</code>) was president in 1977 (year 1),
1978 (year 2), 1979 (year 3), 1980 (year 4), and exited in January 1981
(year 5). Again: years are aggregates of days and it's not evident how else
this information should be perfectly communicated with that in mind. Users
with some R skills can extract the underlying information from the
<code>archigos</code> data and, perhaps, calculate something like the maximum
leader tenure (in days) on either Dec. 31 of the referent year, or leader
exit before Dec. 31 that year, or something to that effect. No matter, I
think this to at least be a defensible variable to present to the user
with those limitations in mind. If the user is interested in leader tenure
in a leader-year analysis, this variable should be fine. If the user is
interested in something like the effect of a fifth year on some kind of
leader behavior, they will want to figure out something else.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>create_leaderyears()</code> takes leader-level data available in
<span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> and returns a leader-year-level data frame. This minimal
output contains the observation ID from Archigos, the year, the state code
for the leader (i.e. either Correlates of War or Gleditsch-Ward, depending
on the <code>standardize</code> argument), the leader's name in Archigos (if it
may help the reader to have that), an approximation of the leader's age,
and the year in office for the leader (as a running count, starting at 1).
