<h2>Determine fraction of evidence which causes segmentation, i.e. sibling peaks at different RTs
confirmed either by genuine or transferred MS/MS.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sometimes, MQ splits a feature into 2 or more if the chromatograpic conditions are not optimal and there
is a drop in RT intensity.
If both features contain successful MS/MS scans, we will find the same peptide twice (with slightly different RT)
in the same charge state. This constitutes a natively split peak and is rare (95

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">peakSegmentation(df_evd_all)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df_evd_all</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data.frame of evidences containing the above columns</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If Match-between-runs is used and the RT alignment is not perfect, then a peptide might be inferred at a wrong
RT position, even though this Raw file already contains MS/MS evidence of this peptide.
Usually the number of peak duplicates rises drastically (e.g. only 75
In most cases, the RT is too far off to be a split peak. It's rather a lucky hit with accidentally the same mass-to-charge,
and thus the intensity is random.
To find by how much these peak pairs differ in RT, use idTransferCheck() and inMatchWindow().
</p>
<p>Required columns are 'is.transferred', 'fc.raw.file', 'modified.sequence', 'charge', 'type'.
</p>
<p>Note that this function must be given MS/MS identifications of type "MULTI-MSMS" and "MSMS-MATCH".
It will stop() otherwise.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.frame with one row per Raw file and 
three columns: 
1) 
2) 
3)
