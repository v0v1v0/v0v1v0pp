<h2>Get Upcoming Bills</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The responses include a legislative_day attribute which is the earliest the bills could be considered and a range attribute that indicates whether the bill information comes from a weekly schedule or a daily one. Combine the two for the best sense of when a bill might come up for consideration. For Senate bills, the response includes a context attribute reproducing the sentence that includes mention of the bill. These responses omit bills that have not yet been assigned a bill number or introduced, and additional bills may be considered at any time.
