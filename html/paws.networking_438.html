enables you to connect a set of virtual interfaces and virtual private
gateways</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a Direct Connect gateway, which is an intermediate object that enables you to connect a set of virtual interfaces and virtual private gateways. A Direct Connect gateway is global and visible in any Amazon Web Services Region after it is created. The virtual interfaces and virtual private gateways that are connected through a Direct Connect gateway can be in different Amazon Web Services Regions. This enables you to connect to a VPC in any Region, regardless of the Region in which the virtual interfaces are located, and pass traffic between them.
