<h2>Returns query execution runtime statistics related to a single execution
of a query if you have access to the workgroup in which the query ran</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns query execution runtime statistics related to a single execution of a query if you have access to the workgroup in which the query ran. Statistics from the <code>Timeline</code> section of the response object are available as soon as QueryExecutionStatus$State is in a SUCCEEDED or FAILED state. The remaining non-timeline statistics in the response (like stage-level input and output row count and data size) are updated asynchronously and may not be available immediately after a query completes. The non-timeline statistics are also not included when a query has row-level filters defined in Lake Formation.
