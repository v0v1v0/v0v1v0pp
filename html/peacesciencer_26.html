<h2>Add UCDP Armed Conflict Data to state-year data frame</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_ucdp_acd()</code> allows you to add UCDP Armed Conflict data to a state-year data frame
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_ucdp_acd(data, type, issue, only_wars = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>state-year data frame</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>the types of armed conflicts the user wants to consider, specified as a character vector.
Options include "extrasystemic", "interstate", "intrastate", and "II". "II" is convenience shorthand for
"internationalized intrastate". If you want just one (say: "intrastate"), then the type you want in quotes
is sufficient. If you want multiple, wrap it in a vector with <code>c()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>issue</code></td>
<td>
<p>do you want to subset the data to just different armed conflicts over different types of issues?
If so, specify those here as you would with the <code>type</code> argument. Options include "territory", "government",
and "both".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>only_wars</code></td>
<td>
<p>subsets the conflict data to just those with intensity levels of "war" (i.e. &gt;1,000 deaths). Defaults to FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Right now, only state-year data are supported. It's worth saying
that "both" in the <code>issue</code> argument should not be understood as
equivalent to <code>c("territory","government")</code>. The former is a kind of
"AND" (in boolean speak) and is an explicit category in the data. The latter
is an "OR" (in boolean speak) and is in all likelihood what you want if you
are tempted to specify "both" in the <code>issue</code> argument.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_ucdp_acd()</code> takes a state-year data frame and returns state-year information from the
UCDP Armed Conflict data set (v. 20.1). The variables returned are whether there is an ongoing armed
conflict in that year, whether there was an armed conflict episode onset that year, what was the maximum
intensity observed that year (if an armed conflict was observed), and a character vector of the associated
conflict IDs that year.
