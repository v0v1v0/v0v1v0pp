<h2>Probability of being a sampled ancestor of another sampled taxon</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function uses models from Foote (1996) to calculate the probability 
of sampling a descendant of a morphotaxon in the fossil record, given the sampling probability 
and estimates of origination and extinction rates.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">probAnc(
  p,
  q,
  R,
  mode = "budding",
  analysis = "directDesc",
  Mmax = 85,
  nrep = 10000
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p</code></td>
<td>
<p>Instantaneous rate of speciation (lambda). If the underlying model assumed is
anagenetic (e.g. taxonomic change within a single lineage, 'phyletic evolution') 
with no branching of lineages, then <code>p</code> will be used as the rate of anagenetic differentiation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>q</code></td>
<td>
<p>Instantaneous rate of extinction (mu)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>R</code></td>
<td>
<p>Per-interval probability of sampling a taxon at least once.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>Mode of morphotaxon differentiation, based on definitions in Foote, 1996. Can be
pure cladogenetic budding (<code>"budding"</code>), 
pure cladogenetic bifurcating (<code>"bifurcating"</code>) or
pure anagenetic within-lineage change 
(<code>"anagenesis"</code>; i.e. Foote's 'phyletic change'). 
Default mode is "budding".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>analysis</code></td>
<td>
<p>The type of analysis to be performed, either the probability of sampling direct
descendants (<code>"directDesc"</code>) or of sampling indirect descendants (<code>"indirectDesc"</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Mmax</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum number of direct descendants (M) to sum over in the function, which
is ideally meant to be a sum from zero to infinity, like <code>nrep</code>. Unfortunately,
<code>(2*M)</code> is used in a factorial, which means we are limited to a relatively
small upper bound on M.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nrep</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of repetitions to run in functions which are meant to sum over infinity.
Default is arbitrarily high.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These values are always calculated assuming infinite time for the potential ancestor
to produce daughter taxa (assuming it lives that long) and under 
homogenous birth, death and sampling rates/probabilities, which is a
situation that may be overly ideal relative to many real fossil records.
</p>
<p>These probabilities can be calculated for either direct descendants, i.e. the probability 
of sampling any morphotaxa that arise immediately from the particular 
morphotaxon that could be an ancestor, or indirect descendants, i.e. the 
probability for any morphotaxon that has the morphotaxon of question as an
ancestor, no matter how distant. See the argument <code>analysis</code> for 
details. Mode of differentiation can also be varied
for three different models, see the argument <code>mode</code>.
</p>
<p>The probability of sampling a taxon's ancestor 
is calculated while accounting for the probability that extinction might
occur before any descendants are produced. Thus, if <code>p = q</code>, the probability of 
a taxon going extinct before it produces any descendants will be 0.5, which 
means that even when sampling is perfect (<code>R = 1</code>, meaning completeness of 
100
can be no higher than 0.5. See Foote (1996) for a graphic depiction of this
non-intuitive ceiling. For reasons (probably?) having to do with finite
approximations of infinite summations, values close to perfect sampling
may have values slightly higher than this ceiling, which is also apparent
visually in the figures in Foote (1996). Thus, values higher than 0.5 when p = q
should be discounted, and in general when sampling rate is high, results should
be treated cautiously as overestimates.
