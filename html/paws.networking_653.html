<h2>Updates the rule settings for the specified rule group</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Updates the rule settings for the specified rule group. You use a rule group by reference in one or more firewall policies. When you modify a rule group, you modify all firewall policies that use the rule group.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/networkfirewall_update_rule_group/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/networkfirewall_update_rule_group/</a> for full documentation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">networkfirewall_update_rule_group(
  UpdateToken,
  RuleGroupArn = NULL,
  RuleGroupName = NULL,
  RuleGroup = NULL,
  Rules = NULL,
  Type = NULL,
  Description = NULL,
  DryRun = NULL,
  EncryptionConfiguration = NULL,
  SourceMetadata = NULL,
  AnalyzeRuleGroup = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>UpdateToken</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to
your requests that access the rule group. The token marks the state of
the rule group resource at the time of the request.
</p>
<p>To make changes to the rule group, you provide the token in your
request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the rule group
hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the
operation fails with an <code>InvalidTokenException</code>. If this happens,
retrieve the rule group again to get a current copy of it with a current
token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again
using the new token.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>RuleGroupArn</code></td>
<td>
<p>The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group.
</p>
<p>You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>RuleGroupName</code></td>
<td>
<p>The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of a
rule group after you create it.
</p>
<p>You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>RuleGroup</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object that defines the rule group rules.
</p>
<p>You must provide either this rule group setting or a <code>Rules</code> setting,
but not both.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Rules</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string containing stateful rule group rules specifications in Suricata
flat format, with one rule per line. Use this to import your existing
Suricata compatible rule groups.
</p>
<p>You must provide either this rules setting or a populated <code>RuleGroup</code>
setting, but not both.
</p>
<p>You can provide your rule group specification in Suricata flat format
through this setting when you create or update your rule group. The call
response returns a RuleGroup object that Network Firewall has populated
from your string.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Type</code></td>
<td>
<p>Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or stateful. If the rule
group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If it is stateful, it
contains stateful rules.
</p>
<p>This setting is required for requests that do not include the
<code>RuleGroupARN</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Description</code></td>
<td>
<p>A description of the rule group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>DryRun</code></td>
<td>
<p>Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to just check the validity
of the request, rather than run the request.
</p>
<p>If set to <code>TRUE</code>, Network Firewall checks whether the request can run
successfully, but doesn't actually make the requested changes. The call
returns the value that the request would return if you ran it with dry
run set to <code>FALSE</code>, but doesn't make additions or changes to your
resources. This option allows you to make sure that you have the
required permissions to run the request and that your request parameters
are valid.
</p>
<p>If set to <code>FALSE</code>, Network Firewall makes the requested changes to your
resources.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>EncryptionConfiguration</code></td>
<td>
<p>A complex type that contains settings for encryption of your rule group
resources.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SourceMetadata</code></td>
<td>
<p>A complex type that contains metadata about the rule group that your own
rule group is copied from. You can use the metadata to keep track of
updates made to the originating rule group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>AnalyzeRuleGroup</code></td>
<td>
<p>Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to analyze the stateless
rules in the rule group for rule behavior such as asymmetric routing. If
set to <code>TRUE</code>, Network Firewall runs the analysis and then updates the
rule group for you. To run the stateless rule group analyzer without
updating the rule group, set <code>DryRun</code> to <code>TRUE</code>.</p>
