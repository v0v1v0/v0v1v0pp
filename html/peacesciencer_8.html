<h2>Add Correlates of War (CoW) Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) data to dyad-year data frame</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_cow_mids()</code> merges in CoW's MID data to a dyad-year data frame.
The version of the CoW-MID data in this package is version 5.0.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_cow_mids(data, keep)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a dyad-year data frame (either "directed" or "non-directed")</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional parameter, specified as a character vector, passed to the function in a <code>select(one_of(.))</code> wrapper. This
allows the user to discard unwanted columns from the directed dispute data so that the output does not consume
too much space in memory. Note: the Correlates of War system codes (<code>ccode1</code>, <code>ccode2</code>), the observation year
(<code>year</code>), the presence or absence of an ongoing MID (<code>cowmidongoing</code>), and the presence or absence of a unique
MID onset (<code>cowmidonset</code>) are <em>always</em> returned. It would be foolish and self-defeating to eliminate those observations.
The user is free to keep or discard anything else they see fit.
</p>
<p>If <code>keep</code> is not specified in the function, the ensuing output returns everything.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Dyads are capable of having multiple disputes in a given year, which can
create a problem for merging into a complete dyad-year data frame.
Consider the case of France and Italy in 1860, which
had three separate dispute onsets that year (MID#0112, MID#0113,
MID#0306), as illustrative of the problem. This merging process employs
several rules to whittle down these duplicate dyad-years for merging
into a dyad-year data frame.
</p>
<p>The function will also return a message to the user about the
case-exclusion rules that went into this process. Users who are
interested in implementing their own case-exclusion rules should
look up the "whittle" class of functions also provided in this
package.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_cow_mids()</code> takes a dyad-year data frame and adds dyad-year dispute information
from the CoW-MID data.
