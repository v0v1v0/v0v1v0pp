<h2>Summary information from random effects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function extracts the different variance components of a
mixed model and returns the result as a data frame.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">random_parameters(model, component = "conditional")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>A mixed effects model (including <code>stanreg</code> models).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>component</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should all parameters, parameters for the conditional model,
for the zero-inflation part of the model, or the dispersion model be returned?
Applies to models with zero-inflation and/or dispersion component. <code>component</code>
may be one of <code>"conditional"</code>, <code>"zi"</code>, <code>"zero-inflated"</code>, <code>"dispersion"</code> or
<code>"all"</code> (default). May be abbreviated.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The variance components are obtained from <code>insight::get_variance()</code> and
are denoted as following:
</p>


<h4>Within-group (or residual) variance</h4>

<p>The residual variance, σ<sup>2</sup><sub>ε</sub>,
is the sum of the distribution-specific variance and the variance due to additive dispersion.
It indicates the <em>within-group variance</em>.
</p>



<h4>Between-group random intercept variance</h4>

<p>The random intercept variance, or <em>between-group</em> variance
for the intercept (τ<sub>00</sub>),
is obtained from <code>VarCorr()</code>. It indicates how much groups
or subjects differ from each other.
</p>



<h4>Between-group random slope variance</h4>

<p>The random slope variance, or <em>between-group</em> variance
for the slopes (τ<sub>11</sub>)
is obtained from <code>VarCorr()</code>. This measure is only available
for mixed models with random slopes. It indicates how much groups
or subjects differ from each other according to their slopes.
</p>



<h4>Random slope-intercept correlation</h4>

<p>The random slope-intercept correlation
(ρ<sub>01</sub>)
is obtained from <code>VarCorr()</code>. This measure is only available
for mixed models with random intercepts and slopes.
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For the within-group and between-group variance, variance
and standard deviations (which are simply the square root of the variance)
are shown.
</p>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with random effects statistics for the variance components,
including number of levels per random effect group, as well as complete
observations in the model.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">if (require("lme4")) {
  data(sleepstudy)
  model &lt;- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1 + Days | Subject), data = sleepstudy)
  random_parameters(model)
}
