<h2>Find the path from root to highest occurrence of each element</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A protoclust object has a prototype associated with each interior node.
Every element being clustered occurs at least as a leaf but might also 
appear multiple times as a prototype.  This function finds for each element
the path from the root to the highest occurrence of that element.  The path
is specified by a series of 0s and 1s, where 0 means "go left" and 1 means
"go right".
