<h2>Randomly Generated Panel Dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data was created by simulation to mimmick a firm level dataset stemming from business tendency surveys.
The data was simulated because of privacy concerns with micro level firm data. For convenience the dataset 
contains two different date notations. Also 5 qualitative 3-item questions are included. Business tendency survey data
is often weighted with company size represented by the number of employees. Thus the weight column is quantitative and
its distribution is somewhat (!) reasonable with respect to the distribution of employees in a typical firm sample.
