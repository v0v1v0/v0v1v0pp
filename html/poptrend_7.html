<h2>Analyze population trends from survey count data.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package provides functions for fitting and analysing trend models of data obtained 
from population count surveys.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package provides functions for estimating smooth trends with generalized additive mixed models, 
as well as linear trends and population indices.
It is intended as a simple interface to basic trend estimation, allowing estimation of
trends accounting for effects of covariates in the form of both smooth terms and random effects.
The model fitting engine is the function <code>gam</code> of package mgcv.
Background for the package is given in Knape (2016).
