<h2>The Stochastic Curtailment method of Boundary Construction</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function <code>SC</code> is used in calls to the functions
<code>GrpSeqBnds</code> and <code>PwrGSD</code> as a possible setting for the
arguments <code>EfficacyBoundary</code> and <code>FutilityBoundary</code>, in
specification of the method whereby efficacy and or futility
boundaries are to be constructed. The Stochastic Curtailment method is
one of four currently availiable choices, the others being
<code>LanDemets</code>, <code>Haybittle</code> (efficacy only) and user specified.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SC(be.end, prob, drift.end = NULL, from = NULL, to = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>be.end</code></td>
<td>
<p>The value of the efficacy criterion in the scale of a
standardized normal. This should be set to something further from
the null than the single test $Z_alpha$. For example if the total type
I error probability is 0.05 in a two sided test of the null than
set be.end to 2.10 or larger (instead of 1.96).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prob</code></td>
<td>
<p>The criterion, a probability to be exceeded in
order to stop. 0.90 or above is a good choice. See detail below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>drift.end</code></td>
<td>
<p>Required only if you are using <code>SC</code> to set the
<code>FutilityBoundary</code>. In this case, set <code>drift.end</code> to the
value of the drift function anticipated at the end of the
trial. See detail below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>from</code></td>
<td>
<p>WARNING EXPERIMENTAL: you can actually construct boundaries via a
hybrid of the 3 boundary construction methods, <code>LanDemets</code>, <code>SC</code>,
and 'user specified'. When using a hybrid boundry, set the argument
<code>EfficacyBoundary</code> or <code>FutilityBoundary</code> respectively,
to a list with components <code>LanDemets</code>, <code>SC</code>, or user
specified numbers. In the former two cases, <code>from</code> and
<code>to</code> are used in <code>LanDemets</code> and also in <code>SC</code>
to stipulate how many interim analyses they are in effect.
See the help for <code>GrpSeqBnds</code> and <code>PwrGSD</code></p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When the stochastic curtailment procedure is used to construct the
efficacy boundary, i.e. <code>EfficacyBoundary</code>=<code>SC(...)</code>,
the efficacy criterion is reached when the conditional probability,
under the null hypothesis, that the last analysis results in
statistical significance, given the present value of the statistic,
exceeds 'prob'. In of itself, this doesn't produce a boundary on the
scale of a standard normal, but it is easily converted to one as is
done here. When this is used to construct a futility boundary, i.e.
<code>FutilityBoundary</code>=<code>SC(...)</code>, the futility criterion is
reached when the conditional probability, under the design alternative
hypothesis, that the last analysis does not result in statistical
significance, given the present value of the statistic, exceeds 'prob'.
The design alternative corresponds to a drift function, which is the
expected value of the statistic normalized to have variance equal to
the information fraction at each interim analysis. For the unweighted
log-rank statistic, the drift function is $(V_T)^(1/2)$ B f, where
B is the logged relative risk, $V_T$ is the variance at the end of the
trial and f is the information fraction.  If the two trial arms are
balanced and the number at risk is roughly constant throughout the
trial then $V_T = pi (1-pi) N_T$, where $pi$ is the constant proportion
at risk in one of the trial arms and $N_T$ is the anticipated number of
events.
