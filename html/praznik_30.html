<h2>Minimal normalised joint mutual information maximisation filter</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The method starts with a feature of a maximal mutual information with the decision <code class="reqn">Y</code>.
Then, it greedily adds feature <code class="reqn">X</code> with a maximal value of the following criterion:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">J(X)=\min_{W\in S} \frac{I(X,W;Y)}{H(X,W,Y)},</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">S</code> is the set of already selected features.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">NJMIM(X, Y, k = 3, threads = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>Attribute table, given as a data frame with either factors (preferred), booleans, integers (treated as categorical) or reals (which undergo automatic categorisation; see below for details).
Single vector will be interpreted as a data.frame with one column.
<code>NA</code>s are not allowed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Y</code></td>
<td>
<p>Decision attribute; should be given as a factor, but other options are accepted, exactly like for attributes.
<code>NA</code>s are not allowed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of attributes to select.
Must not exceed <code>ncol(X)</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threads</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of threads to use; default value, 0, means all available to OpenMP.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with two elements: <code>selection</code>, a vector of indices of the selected features in the selection order, and <code>score</code>, a vector of corresponding feature scores.
Names of both vectors will correspond to the names of features in <code>X</code>.
Both vectors will be at most of a length <code>k</code>, as the selection may stop sooner, even during initial selection, in which case both vectors will be empty.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>NJMIM is a normalised version of <code>JMIM</code>; <code>JMI</code> and <code>DISR</code> are modifications of JMIM and NJMIM in which a sum of joint information over already selected features is used instead of a minimum.
It stops returning features when the best score reaches 0.
</p>
<p>The method requires input to be discrete to use empirical estimators of distribution, and, consequently, information gain or entropy.
To allow smoother user experience, praznik automatically coerces non-factor vectors in inputs, which requires additional time, memory and may yield confusing results – the best practice is to convert data to factors prior to feeding them in this function.
Real attributes are cut into about 10 equally-spaced bins, following the heuristic often used in literature.
Precise number of cuts depends on the number of objects; namely, it is <code class="reqn">n/3</code>, but never less than 2 and never more than 10.
Integers (which technically are also numeric) are treated as categorical variables (for compatibility with similar software), so in a very different way – one should be aware that an actually numeric attribute which happens to be an integer could be coerced into a <code class="reqn">n</code>-level categorical, which would have a perfect mutual information score and would likely become a very disruptive false positive.
