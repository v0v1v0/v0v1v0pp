<h2>
Type I error rate for two simultaneous TOST procedures
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Was designed to calculate the type I error rate of two simultaneous TOST procedures 
(where the two parameters of the two TOSTs are correlated with some correlation)
for various study designs used in BE studies.
</p>
<p>Is defunct now since it suffers from insufficient precision to obtain the 
type 1 error (TIE) via simulations.<br> 
Due to the intersection-union principle the TIE is always upper bounded 
to alpha by theory.
