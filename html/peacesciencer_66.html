<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Information about leaders come from Archigos (v. 4.1). GML MID Data are version 2.2.1. The <code>data-raw</code> directory
contains information about how these data were generated. There is invariably going to be some guesswork here because
dates are sometimes not known with precision. Sometimes, a dispute coincides even with a leadership change when dates are
known with precision. The source script includes a discussion of these cases and shows how the data were generated with all
these caveats in mind.
</p>
<p>Do note that participants can have several episodes within a dispute. Sometimes participants switch sides (e.g. Romania in World War 2).
Sometime participants drop in and out of a long-running dispute (e.g. Syria, prominently, in MID#4182).
</p>
<p>"Dummy" start days and end days are there to serve as a parlor trick in assigning disputes to leaders in leader-level analyses. Where days
are known with precision, the dummy day is that number. In most cases, where the day is not known with precision coincides with a month
that has no leader transition. Thus, the start day that gets imputed is going to be the first of the month (for the dummy start day)
or the last of the month (for the dummy end day). Cases where there was a leader transition (or two) that month may require some more
sensitive imputing. For example, our best guess is Antonio Guzmán Blanco of Venezuela is president for the end of MID#1639, given his
role in trying to negotiate a conclusion to the dispute. Archigos has him leaving office on the 7th, so that's the end day that gets imputed
for him. Again, these are here to serve as a parlor trick in assigning disputes to leaders for leader-level analyses. Be careful about using
these data for calculating dispute-participant duration. In fact: don't do that.
