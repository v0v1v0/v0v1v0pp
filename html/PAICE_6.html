<h2>Inference of minimum number of colonization events</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A inference of the minimum number of colonization events between islands of
an archipelago considering both haplotype distributions and genealogy.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">colonization(data, network)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>

<p>a data frame containing the matrix of occurrences of haplotypes in the
islands of an archipelago (applicable to any island-like system). The
first two columns indicate islands and populations sampled. Successive
columns indicate haplotype occurrences (one column per haplotype). If
present, missing haplotypes must also be included (i.e. columns without
occurrences).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>network</code></td>
<td>

<p>a data frame containing the genealogy of haplotypes. The first column
indicates the haplotype, the second column indicates its ancestral
haplotype and the third column indicates the variable position changed
between an haplotype and its ancestral haplotype. If present, missing
haplotypes must also be included. The ancestral haplotype must be
connected to an outgroup named <code>"OUT"</code>, located in the first row of
the data frame, and has a variable position not shared with other
connections.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Colonization events are inferred following Coello et al. (2022).
</p>
<p>Each haplotype produces a number of colonization events equal to the total
number of islands in which the haplotype occurs minus one. These are type 1
colonization events (<code>c1</code>).
</p>
<p>Additionally, colonization events between an ancestral haplotype and the
derived haplotypes are also inferred if the ancestral haplotype occurs in
different islands than the derived haplotypes. These inferred colonization
events correspond to type 2 (<code>c2</code>) and type 3 (<code>c3</code>) colonization
events.
</p>
<p>A type 2 colonization events is that between a haplotype and its ancestral
haplotype that can only be assigned to the connection between these two
haplotypes. These colonization events are noted in the derived haplotype.
</p>
<p>Type 3 colonization events are those (one or more) inferred between an
ancestral haplotype and its derived haplotypes but that cannot be assigned
to a specific connection, so colonization events are assigned to the
ancestral haplotype.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>colonization</code> returns an object of <code>class</code>
<code>"colonization"</code>.
</p>
<p>The function <code>print</code> shows the total of colonization events inferred.
The function <code>summary</code> returns a more detailed output showing a
description of data used and inferred colonization events by haplotype and
by type.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><code>colonization</code> only considers the complete sampling. To correct the
inference by field and genetic sampling use <code>rarecol</code>.
