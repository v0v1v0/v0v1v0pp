Quarterly U.K. economic time series from 1957 Q3 to 1967 Q4

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data are quarterly, seasonally unadjusted in 1958 prices, covering the period

about consumers' expenditure on goods and services, Investment, inventory investment, 
imports of goods and services, gross domestic product, and personal disposable income.
Prothero and Wallis (1976) fitted several models to each series and compared
their performance with a multivariate model.
