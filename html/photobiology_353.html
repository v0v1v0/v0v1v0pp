<h2>Create tagged spectrum from wavebands</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a generic_spct object with wavelengths from the range of wavebands in
a list. The spectrum is suitable for plotting labels, symbols, rectangles or
similar, as the midpoint of each waveband is added to the spectrum.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">wb2rect_spct(w.band, short.names = TRUE, chroma.type = "CMF")

fast_wb2rect_spct(w.band, chroma.type = "CMF", simplify = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>w.band</code></td>
<td>
<p>waveband or list of waveband objects The waveband(s) determine
the wavelengths in variable <code>w.length</code> of the returned spectrum</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>short.names</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical Flag indicating whether to use short or long names
for wavebands</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>chroma.type</code></td>
<td>
<p>character telling whether "CMF", "CC", or "both" should be
returned for human vision, or an object of class <code>chroma_spct</code> for any
other trichromic visual system.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>simplify</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical Flag indicating whether to merge neighboring
rectangles of equal color. Simplification is done only for narrow
wavebands.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>generic.spectrum</code> object, with columns w.length, wl.low,
wl.hi, wl.color, wb.color and wb.name. The w.length values are the
midpoint of the wavebands, wl.low and wl.high give the boundaries of the
wavebands, wl.color the color definition corresponding to the wavelength at
the center of the waveband and wb.color the color of the waveband as a
whole (assuming a flat energy irradiance spectrum). Different spectral data
variables are set to zero and added making the returned value compatible
with classes derived from <code>generic_spct</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Function <code>fast_wb2rect_spct()</code> differs from <code>wb2rect_spct()</code>
in that it computes colors for narrow wavebands based on the midpoint
wavelength and uses vectorization when possible. It always returns color
definitions with short names, which are also used as waveband names for
narrow wavebands and merged wavebands. The purpose of merging of rectangles
is to speed up rendering and to reduce the size of vector graphics output.
This function should be used with care as the color definitions returned
are only approximate and original waveband names can be lost.
