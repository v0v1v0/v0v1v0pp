<h3>Generic, shop branded or distributor branded</h3>

<p>We group under this category shop-branded or generic (no-brand) lamps that
usually have specifications with limited details. These lamps are unlikely to
remain consistent from batch to batch or have limited availability.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Some of the lamps are from resellers' brands, usually obscure ones, and
others are from well-known brands. Some of the brands have changed 
ownership through take-overs and merges. When known the vintage is 
indicated in the comment field of each spectrum. Multiple brands may also
belong to the same company.
