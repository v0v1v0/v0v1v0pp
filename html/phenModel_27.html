<h2>
Estimated Parameters for the Weibull Model for P. Vulgatissima
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Matrix of estimated parameters for each stage of the life-cycle of P. vulgatissima
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("pvulg_weibull_parameters")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The format is:
num [1:3, 1:6] 0.7207 0.3517 1.7918 -0.0716 0.5117 ...
- attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
..$ : chr [1:3] "gamma" "eta" "beta"
..$ : chr [1:6] "post_diapause" "ovipositing" "larva_emergence" "pupa_emergence" ...
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The parameters were derived based on constant temperature laboratory experiments (see Pollard, 2014) for different life-cycle stages of P. vulgatissima. Development times (or rates) were derived as cumulative frequency distributions at each temperature; development times for each percentile were then divided by the respective median value of the distribution to produce a normalised ("same shape") distribution of development times at each temperature (Wagner et al., 1984; 1991). Based on the "same shape" assumption, a single cumulative distribution representing the normalised distributions for all temperature treatments was produced by averaging all the distributions, weighted by the total frequency of each distribution (Wagner et al., 1984; 1991).
