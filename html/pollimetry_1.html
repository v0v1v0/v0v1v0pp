<h2>Converts the intertegular distance (IT) and co-variates to body size in dry weight (mg) for bees or hoverflies.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates body size in dry weight (mg) from Kendall et al. (2018) using ITD (and co-variate) values.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bodysize(x, taxa, type)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame with columns containing 'IT' values and Sex ('Male' or 'Female'). 
Optional attributes depending on model choice: Taxonomy ('Family' for bees or 'Subfamily for hoverflies), 'Region' (Currently only "NorthAmerica", "SouthAmerica", "Australasia" and "Europe" implemented) and 'Species' ("Genus_species" format). Non-implemented regions and/or species are acceptable. See details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>taxa</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector specifying insect taxa of interest, can be either "bee" for bee models and "hov" for hoverfly models</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector specifying model type to be used: for bees this can be either "taxo" for the full taxonomic model, "phy" for the full phylogenetic model, "sex" for the reduced sexual dimorphic model or "IT" for the ITD-only model. In hoverflies: it can either be "taxo" for the full taxonomic model, "sex" for the reduced sexual dimorphic model or "IT" for the ITD-only model.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For bees, type option 'taxo' requires IT, 
sex and taxonomic family.  Type option 'phylo' only requires ITD and Sex to run 
but should be only be used for with Species (and Region) included in model formulation n.b. the function checks for contained species.  
</p>
<p>For hoverflies, type 'taxo' requires ITD, Subfamily and Sex for each specimen. Type "ITD" for both 
taxa only requires ITD values (Optional: region and species but check 'setdiff'). 
If specimens are from included regions or species (see above) we recommend 
including these as additional columns. Estimates (and variance components) are 
returned as four additional columns bound to the original dataframe. In the likely case that non-represented taxa and regions are included in inputted datasets, 'allow_new_levels' is set to true for all models. Estimates will then be modelled with group-level uncertainty in the predictions based on the variation of the existing levels.
This function makes use of external model objects hosted on GitHub. In the case of slow loading, we recommend you download the pollimetrydata package from https://github.com/liamkendall/pollimetrydata.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The original dataframe (x) is returned along with four additional columns: body size (dry weight (mg)), S.E. and 90
