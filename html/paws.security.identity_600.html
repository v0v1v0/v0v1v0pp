<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>OldPassword</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The IAM user's current password.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>NewPassword</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The new password. The new password must conform to the Amazon Web
Services account's password policy, if one exists.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex">regex pattern</a> that is used to
validate this parameter is a string of characters. That string can
include almost any printable ASCII character from the space (<code>U+0020</code>)
through the end of the ASCII character range (<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠U+00FF⁠</code>). You can also
include the tab (<code>U+0009</code>), line feed (<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠U+000A⁠</code>), and carriage return
(<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠U+000D⁠</code>) characters. Any of these characters are valid in a password.
However, many tools, such as the Amazon Web Services Management Console,
might restrict the ability to type certain characters because they have
special meaning within that tool.</p>
