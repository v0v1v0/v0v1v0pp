<h2>Truck emissions data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The particulate matter emissions data, taken from the Coordinating Research Councils
E55/E59 research project (Clark et al. 2007). In the project,
trucks were placed on the chassis dynamometer bed to mimic
inertia and particulate matter was measured by an emission analyzer on standard test cycles. The engine acceleration of diesel
trucks was also recorded.
