<h2>Matrix of prior limits</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>this imports a matrix with the limits of the prior distribution
for each parameter. Each row of the matrix is a different parameter,
indicated by the row name. The matrix contains two columns, the first being
the minimum value of the distribution and the second being the maximum
value.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">limits
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>a matrix with 8 rows and 2 columns. Each of the rows corresponds to a
different parameter:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>N1</dt>
<dd>
<p>relative size of the first population. This population
corresponds to the C ecotype.</p>
</dd>
<dt>N2</dt>
<dd>
<p>relative size of the second population. This population
corresponds to the W ecotype.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Split</dt>
<dd>
<p>time, in 4Nref scale, of the split event that creates the two
populations.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PoolError</dt>
<dd>
<p>error associated with DNA pooling.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SeqError</dt>
<dd>
<p>error associated with DNA sequencing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>pM</dt>
<dd>
<p>proportion of the genome with no barriers against gene flow. This
is the proportion of simulated loci where migration occurs in both
directions between the divergent ecotypes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>mig_CW</dt>
<dd>
<p>scaled migration rate between the two divergent ecotypes This
is the migration rate from ecotype C to ecotype W.</p>
</dd>
<dt>mig_WC</dt>
<dd>
<p>scaled migration rate between the two divergent ecotypes This
is the migration rate from ecotype W to ecotype C.</p>
</dd> </dl>
