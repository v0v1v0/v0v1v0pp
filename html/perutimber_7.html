<h2>Search species name present in the  Catalogue of the timber forest species of
the Amazon and the Peruvian Yunga</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes a species list and tries to match a name in the Catalogue
of the timber forest species of the Amazon and the Peruvian Yunga, checking
if the name is listed in tha dataset.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">search_perutimber(splist, max_distance = 0.2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>splist</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector specifying the input taxon, each element
including genus and specific epithet and, potentially, infraspecific rank,
infraspecific name and author name.
Only valid characters are allowed (see <code>base::validEnc</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max_distance</code></td>
<td>
<p>match when comparing the submitted name with the closest
name matches in the species listed in the "Catalogue of the timber forest
species of the Amazon and the Peruvian Yunga". The distance used is a generalized
Levenshtein distance that indicates the total number of insertions, deletions,
and substitutions allowed to match the two names. It can be expressed as an
integer or as the fraction of the binomial name.
For example, a name with length 10, and a max_distance = 0.1, allow only one
change (insertion, deletion, or substitution). A max_distance = 2, allows two
changes.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A character vector that can have three different output values. The first
value, "Present," indicates whether the species name is fully matched with the
names listed in the 'Catalogue of the timber forest species of the Amazon and the
Peruvian Yunga'. The second value, "P_updated_name," provides a fuzzy matching of
species names. If a species name is not listed in the catalogue, the third value
returned will be an empty string.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# Search for multiple species vector
splist &lt;- c("Euterpe precatoria var. precatorio",
            "Welfia alfredi",
            "Hibiscus abelmoschus var. betulifolius")

# Search for multiple species data.frame
# base
