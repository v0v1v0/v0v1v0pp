<h2>Group Regression Models for Risk Protein Complex Identification</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Two protein complex-based group regression models (PCLasso and PCLasso2) for risk protein complex identification. PCLasso is a prognostic model that identifies risk protein complexes associated with survival. PCLasso2 is a classification model that identifies risk protein complexes associated with classes. For more information, see Wang and Liu (2021) &lt;doi:10.1093/bib/bbab212&gt;. 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The PCLasso model accepts a protein expression
matrix, survival data, and protein complexes for training the prognostic
model, and makes predictions for new samples and identifies risk protein
complexes associated with survival.
</p>
<p>The PCLasso2 model accepts a protein expression matrix, a response vector,
and protein complexes for training the classification model, and makes
predictions for new samples and identifies risk protein complexes associated
with classes.
</p>
<p>Both PCLasso and PCLasso2 use <code>grLasso</code> as the penalty function. The
other two penalties <code>grSCAD</code> and <code>grMCP</code> can also be used for model
construction and risk protein complex identification. The package also
provides methods for plotting coefficient paths and cross-validation curves.
