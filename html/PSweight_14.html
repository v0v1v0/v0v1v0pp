<h2>Estimate average causal effects by propensity score weighting</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function <code>PSweight</code> is used to estimate the average potential outcomes corresponding to
each treatment group among the target population. The function currently implements
the following types of weights: the inverse probability of treatment weights (IPW: target population is the combined population),
average treatment effect among the treated weights (treated: target population is the population receiving a specified treatment),
overlap weights (overlap: target population is the overlap population at clinical equipoise), matching weights (matching: target population
is population obtained under 1:1 matching), entropy weights (entropy: target population is the population weighted by the entropy function).
Augmented propensity score weighting estimators are also allowed, with propensity scores and outcome model estimates either estimated
within the function, or supplied by external routines.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A typical form for <code>ps.formula</code> is <code>treatment ~ terms</code> where <code>treatment</code> is the treatment
variable (identical to the variable name used to specify <code>zname</code>) and <code>terms</code> is a series of terms
which specifies a linear predictor for <code>treatment</code>. Similarly, a typical form for <code>out.formula</code> is
<code>outcome ~ terms</code> where <code>outcome</code> is the outcome variable (identical to the variable name
used to specify <code>yname</code>) and <code>terms</code> is a series of terms which specifies a linear
predictor for <code>outcome</code>. Both <code>ps.formula</code> and <code>out.formula</code> by default specify generalized
linear models when <code>ps.estimate</code> and/or <code>out.estimate</code> is <code>NULL</code>. The argument <code>ps.method</code> and <code>out.method</code> allow user to choose
model other than glm to fit the propensity score and outcome regression models for augmentation. Additional argument in the <code>gbm()</code> function can be supplied through the <code>ps.control</code> and <code>out.control</code> argument. Please refer to the user manual of the <code>gbm</code> package for all the
allowed arguments.  <code>"SuperLearner"</code> is also allowed in the <code>ps.method</code> and <code>out.method</code> arguments. Currently, the SuperLearner method only supports binary treatment with the default method set to <code>"SL.glm"</code>. The estimation approach is default to <code>"method.NNLS"</code> for both propensity and outcome regression models.
Prediction algorithm and other tuning parameters can also be passed through<code>ps.control</code> and <code>out.control</code>. Please refer to the user manual of the <code>SuperLearner</code> package for all the allowed specifications.
</p>
<p>When comparing two treatments, <code>ps.estimate</code> can either be a vector or a two-column matrix of estimated
propensity scores. If a vector is supplied, it is assumed to be the propensity scores to receive the treatment, and
the treatment group corresponds to the last group in the alphebatic order, unless otherwise specified by <code>trtgrp</code>.
When comparing multiple (J&gt;=3) treatments, <code>ps.estimate</code> needs to be specified as an N by J matrix,
where N indicates the number of observations, and J indicates the total number of treatments.
This matrix specifies the estimated generalized propensity scores to receive each of the J treatments.
In general, <code>ps.estimate</code> should have column names that indicate the level of the treatment variable,
which should match the levels given in <code>Z</code>.
If column names are empty or there is a mismatch, the column names will be created following
the alphebatic order of values in <code>Z</code>, and the rightmost coulmn of <code>ps.estimate</code> is assumed
to be the treatment group, when estimating ATT. <code>trtgrp</code> can also be used to specify the treatment
group for estimating ATT. The same mechanism applies to <code>out.estimate</code>, except that the input for <code>out.estimate</code>
must be an N by J matrix, where each row corresponds to the estimated potential outcomes (corresponding to each treatment)
for each observation.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>zname</code> and/or <code>yname</code> is required when <code>ps.estimate</code>
and/or <code>out.estimate</code> is not <code>NULL</code>.
</p>
<p>Current version of <code>PSweight</code> allows for five types of propensity score weights used to estimate ATE (IPW), ATT (treated) and
ATO (overlap), ATM (matching) and ATEN (entropy). These weights are members of larger class of balancing weights defined in Li, Morgan, and Zaslavsky (2018).
Specific definitions of these weights are provided in Li, Morgan, and Zaslavsky (2018), Li and Greene (2013), Zhou, Matsouaka and Thomas (2020).
When there is a practical violation of the positivity assumption, <code>delta</code> defines the symmetric
propensity score trimming rule following Crump et al. (2009). With multiple treatments, <code>delta</code> defines the
multinomial trimming rule introduced in Yoshida et al. (2019). The overlap weights can also be considered as
a data-driven continuous trimming strategy without specifying trimming rules, see Li, Thomas and Li (2019).
Additional details on balancing weights and generalized overlap weights for multiple treatment groups are provided in
Li and Li (2019).
</p>
<p>If <code>augmentation = TRUE</code>, an augmented weighting estimator will be implemented. For binary treatments, the augmented
weighting estimator is presented in Mao, Li and Greene (2018). For multiple treatments, the augmented weighting estimator is
mentioned in Li and Li (2019), and additional details will appear in our ongoing work (Zhou et al. 2020+). When
<code>weight = "IPW"</code>, the augmented estimator is also referred to as a doubly-robust (DR) estimator.
</p>
<p>When <code>bootstrap = TRUE</code>, the variance will be calculated by nonparametric bootstrap, with <code>R</code> bootstrap
replications. The default of <code>R</code> is 50. Otherwise, the variance will be calculated using the sandwich variance
formula obtained in the M-estimation framework.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>PSweight returns a <code>PSweight</code> object containing a list of the following values:
estimated propensity scores, average potential outcomes corresponding to each treatment,
