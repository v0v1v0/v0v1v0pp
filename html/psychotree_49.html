<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Germany's Next Topmodel is a German casting television show (based on a
concept introduced in the United States) hosted by Heidi Klum (see Wikipedia 2009).
The second season of the show aired March–May 2007.
</p>
<p>A survey was conducted at the Department of Psychology, Universität Tübingen,
in 2007 shortly after the final show. The sample was stratified by gender and
age (younger versus older than 30 years) with 48 participants in each group.
</p>
<p>Digital photographs (resolution 303 times 404 pixels) of the top six
contestants were available from the ProSieben web page at the time of the survey.
The photos were selected to be comparable, showing the contestant's face and the
upper part of the body, all women being casually dressed.
</p>
<p>Participants were presented with all 15 pairs of photographs. On each trial,
their task was to judge which of the two women on the photos was the more
attractive. In order to assess the participants' expertise, additional
questions regarding their familiarity with the show were asked after the
pairwise comparisons were completed.
</p>
<p>The actual ranking, as resulting from sequential elimination during the
course of the show, was (from first to sixth place): Barbara, Anni, Hana,
Fiona, Mandy, Anja.
