<h2>Pedometric Tools and Techniques</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package contains many tools and techniques used in the field of pedometrics (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedometric_mapping for a definition of <em>pedometrics</em>). These tools
and techniques were developed to fulfill the demands created by the PhD research project
(2012-2016) entitled “Contribution to the Construction of Models for Predicting Soil
Properties”, developed by Alessandro Samuel-Rosa under the supervision of Dr Lúcia HC Anjos
(Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), Dr Gustavo M Vasques (Embrapa Solos,
Brazil), and Dr Gerard B M Heuvelink (ISRIC - World Soil Information, the Netherlands). The
project is/was funded by the CNPq Foundation (Process 140720/2012-0), Ministry of Science
and Technology of Brazil, Brasília, DF, 70040-020, Brazil, phone +55 (61) 2022 6002, and the
CAPES Foundation (Process ID BEX 11677/13-9), Ministry of Education of Brazil, Brasília, DF,

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Several functions simply extend the functionalities of other functions commonly used for the
analysis of pedometric data. It should be noted that changes are likely to occur quite often and
the use of this package as a dependency for other packages is strongly discouraged.
