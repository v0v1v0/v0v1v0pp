<h2>Preregistration Template for Qualitative and Quantitative Ethnographic Studies</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A preregistration is a way to design your research project before you
begin and to document your decisions, rationale. A template such as
this one can be employed to think about what you want to do and how,
and subsequently, if you wish, you can submit the finished preregistration
to a registry, such as OSF's (https://osf.io/registries/). This template
was developed to aid the preregistration of quantitative ethnographic
studies, but due to its modular nature, it can be employed for qualitative
studies as well.
