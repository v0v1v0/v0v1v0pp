<h2>Map diseases to phecodes via HPO terms</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A mapping of diseases to their clinical features, represented as phecodes,
is required for calculating phenotype risk scores.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mapDiseaseToPhecode(
  diseaseHpoMap = phers::diseaseHpoMap,
  hpoPhecodeMap = phers::hpoPhecodeMap
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>diseaseHpoMap</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data.table containing the mapping between diseases and
HPO terms. Must have columns <code>disease_id</code> and <code>term_id</code>. Default is the map
included in this package.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hpoPhecodeMap</code></td>

and phecodes. Must have columns <code>term_id</code> and <code>phecode</code>. Default is the map
included in this package.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.table with columns <code>disease_id</code> and <code>phecode</code>.
