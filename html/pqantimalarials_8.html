<h2>Start the pqantimalarials interactive web tool.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function starts the interactive web tool which
runs locally on the user's machine. If the browser doesn't
open automatically, the function provides the url so you can
manually open your browser and view the site. This function
normally does not return; interrupt R to stop the application
(usually by pressing Esc or Ctrl+C).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">webtool()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Within the web tool, the left panel allows users to set input
parameters that are then used to estimate the number of under-five
child deaths associated with poor-quality antimalarials in
sub-Saharan Africa according to the model presented in
Renschler et al. (2014). Users can browse through the site's tabs to
explore the outputs from uncertainty and sensitivity analyses that
were performed using their input settings. Users can download the
output data and visualizations as CSVs and PDFs respectively.
