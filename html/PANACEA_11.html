<h2>PANACEA: Personalized Network-based Anti-Cancer Therapy Evaluation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Identification of the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for each patient based
on genomic alterations is a major challenge in personalized oncology.
<code>PANACEA</code> is a collection of personalized anti-cancer drug prioritization
approaches utilizing network methods. The methods utilize personalized
"driverness" scores from 'driveR' to rank drugs, mapping these onto a
protein-protein interaction network (PIN). The "distance-based" method scores
each drug based on these scores and distances between drugs and genes to rank
given drugs. The "RWR" method propagates these scores via a random-walk with
restart framework to rank the drugs.
