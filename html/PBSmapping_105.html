<h2>PBS Mapping: Draw Maps and Implement Other GIS Procedures</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This software has evolved from fisheries research
conducted at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in Nanaimo,
British Columbia, Canada. It extends the R language to include
two-dimensional plotting features similar to those commonly
available in a Geographic Information System (GIS).  Embedded
C code speeds algorithms from computational geometry, such as
finding polygons that contain specified point events or
converting between longitude-latitude and Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) coordinates.  It includes data for a global
shoreline and other data sets in the public domain.
</p>
<p>For a complete user's guide, see the file <code>PBSmapping-UG.pdf</code> 
in the R directory <code>.../library/PBSmapping/doc</code>.
</p>
<p><code>PBSmapping</code> includes 10 demos that appear as figures in 
the User's Guide. To see them, run the function <code>.PBSfigs()</code>.
</p>
<p>More generally, a user can view all demos available from locally 
installed packages with the function <code>runDemos()</code> in our 
related (and recommended) package <code>PBSmodelling</code>.
