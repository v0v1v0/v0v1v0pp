<h2>Bayesian variable selection using power-expected-posterior prior</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Performs Bayesian variable selection under normal linear
models for the data with the model parameters following as prior either
the PEP or the intrinsic (a special case of the former). 
The prior distribution on model space is the 
uniform on model space or the uniform on model dimension (a special case 
of the beta-binomial prior). Posterior model probabilities and marginal
likelihoods can be derived in closed-form expressions under this setup. 
The selection can be done either with full enumeration of all possible 
models (for small–to–moderate model spaces) or using the MC3 algorithm 
(for large model spaces). Complementary functions for making predictions, 
as well as plotting and printing the results are also available.
