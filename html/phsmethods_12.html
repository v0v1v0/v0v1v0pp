<h2>Format a postcode</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>format_postcode</code> takes a character string or vector of
character strings. It extracts the input values which adhere to the standard
UK postcode format (with or without spaces), assigns the appropriate amount
of spacing to them (for both pc7 and pc8 formats) and ensures all letters
are capitalised.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">format_postcode(x, format = c("pc7", "pc8"), quiet = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string or vector of character strings. Input values
which adhere to the standard UK postcode format may be upper or lower case
and will be formatted regardless of existing spacing. Any input values which
do not adhere to the standard UK postcode format will generate an NA and a
warning message - see <strong>Value</strong> section for more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>format</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string denoting the desired output format. Valid
options are <code>pc7</code> and <code>pc8</code>. The default is <code>pc7</code>. See <strong>Value</strong>
section for more information on the string length of output values.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quiet</code></td>
<td>
<p>(optional) If quiet is <code>TRUE</code> all messages and warnings will be
suppressed. This is useful in a production context and when you are sure of
the data or you are specifically using this function to remove invalid
postcodes. This will also make the function a bit quicker as fewer checks
are performed.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The standard UK postcode format (without spaces) is:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> 1 or 2 letters, followed by
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 1 number, followed by
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 1 optional letter or number, followed by
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 1 number, followed by
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 2 letters
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/283357/ILRSpecification2013_14Appendix_C_Dec2012_v1.pdf">UK government regulations</a>
mandate which letters and numbers can be used in specific sections of a
postcode. However, these regulations are liable to change over time. For
this reason, <code>format_postcode</code> does not validate whether a given
postcode actually exists, or whether specific numbers and letters are being
used in the appropriate places. It only assesses whether the given input is
consistent with the above format and, if so, assigns the appropriate amount
of spacing and capitalises any lower case letters.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>When <code>format</code> is set equal to <code>pc7</code>, <code>format_postcode</code>
returns a character string of length 7. 5 character postcodes have two
spaces after the 2nd character; 6 character postcodes have 1 space after the
3rd character; and 7 character postcodes have no spaces.
</p>
<p>When <code>format</code> is set equal to <code>pc8</code>, <code>format_postcode</code> returns
a character string with maximum length 8. All postcodes, whether 5, 6 or 7
characters, have one space before the last 3 characters.
</p>
<p>Any input values which do not adhere to the standard UK postcode format will
generate an NA output value and a warning message. A warning is generated
rather than an error so as not to let one erroneously recorded postcode in a
large input vector prevent the remaining entries from being appropriately
formatted.
</p>
<p>Any input values which do adhere to the standard UK postcode format but
contain lower case letters will generate a warning message explaining that
these letters will be capitalised.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">format_postcode("G26QE")
format_postcode(c("KA89NB", "PA152TY"), format = "pc8")

library(dplyr)
df &lt;- tibble(postcode = c("G429BA", "G207AL", "DD37JY", "DG98BS"))
df %&gt;%
  mutate(postcode = format_postcode(postcode))
