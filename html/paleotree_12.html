<h2>Partitions the branch lengths of a tree into several classes based on their placement.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Partitions the branch lengths of a tree into several classes based on their placement.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">branchClasses(tree, whichExtant = NULL, tol = 0.01)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tree</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dated phylogeny to be analyzed, as an object of class <code>phylo</code>, 
ideally with a <code>$root.time</code> element as is typical for <code>paleotree</code> output phylogenies. 
If <code>$root.time</code> is not present, the most recent tips will be interpreted as 
being at the modern day (i.e. 0 time-units before present).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>whichExtant</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical vector with length equal to number of tips in the tree. A <code>TRUE</code> value indicates
that the respective tip taxon (as indicated by the ordering of the tip labels) that is extant
at the modern day, while <code>FALSE</code> values equate to the respect being extinct at the present day. 
If present, this vector is used for determining which taxa are extant, and which are extinct.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tol</code></td>
<td>
<p>Tolerance used to distinguish extant taxa, 
if <code>whichExtant</code> is not provided, to avoid issues with number rounding. 
Taxa within <code>tol</code> of the modern day will be considered extant.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function will partition the internode 
(node to node, including internal node to terminal tip) branch lengths of a tree into 
four separate classes: <code>all</code> (all the internode branches of a tree), <code>int</code> (internal branches
which run from one internode to another), <code>live</code> (terminal branches which run from an internal node to 
a terminal tip representing an extinction event before the present) and <code>dead</code> (terminal branches 
which run from an internal node to a terminal tip at the modern day, reflecting a still-living taxon).
</p>
<p>The depths of the internal 'mother' node (i.e. time of origin, before the modern day) 
of each branch length are included as the labels of the branch length vectors.
</p>
<p>This function is mainly of use for modeling internode branch lengths in a phylogeny including fossil taxa.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The output is a list consisting of four vectors, with the labels of the vectors being their
corresponding time of origin. See details.
</p>
