<h2>Generalized Systematic Review Registration Form</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This paper presents a generalized registration form for systematic reviews
that can be used when currently available forms are not adequate. The form
is designed to be applicable across disciplines (i.e., psychology,
economics, law, physics, or any other field) and across review types
(i.e., scoping review, review of qualitative studies, meta-analysis, or
any other type of review). That means that the reviewed records may include
research reports as well as archive documents, case law, books, poems, etc.
Items were selected and formulated to optimize broad applicability instead
of specificity, forgoing some benefits afforded by a tighter focus. This
PRISMA 2020 compliant form is a fallback for more specialized forms and
can be used if no specialized form or registration platform is available.
When accessing this form on the Open Science Framework website, users will
therefore first be guided to specialized forms when they exist. In addition
to this use case, the form can also serve as a starting point for creating
registration forms that cater to specific fields or review types.
