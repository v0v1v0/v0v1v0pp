<h2>Principal component gene set enrichment (PCGSE) algorithm</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implementation of the PCGSE algorithm. Computes the statistical association between gene sets and the principal components of 
experimental data using a two-stage competitive test. Supported gene-level test statistics include the
PC loadings for each genomic variable, the Pearson correlation coefficients between each genomic variable and each PC
and the Fisher-transformed correlation coefficients. 
The input data is centered and scaled so that eigendecomposition is computed on the sample
correlation matrix rather than the sample covariance matrix. 
Because the PC loadings for PCA on a correlation matrix are proportional to the
Pearson correlation coefficients between each PC and each variable, all supported gene-level statistics provide a measure of correlation
between genomic variables and PCs.
Each gene set is quantified using either a standardized mean difference statistic or a standardized rank sum statistic. 
The statistical significance of each gene set test statistic is computed according to a competitive null hypothesis using 
either a parametric test, a correlation-adjusted parametric test or a permutation test.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gene.set.statistic</code></td>

</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> "mean.diff": The standardized difference between the mean of the gene-level statistics for members of the gene set and the mean
of the gene-level statistics for genomic variables not in the gene set. Equivalent to the U_D statistic from Barry et al.

</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gene.set.test</code></td>
<td>
<p>The statistical test used to compute the significance of the gene set statistics under a competitive null hypothesis.
The "parametric" test is in the "class 1" test category according to Barry et al., 
the "cor.adj.parametric" and "permutation" tests are in the "class 2" test category according to Barry et al.
Must be one of the following (default is "cor.adj.parametric"):
</p>
             
<ul>
<li>
<p> "parametric": If the mean difference is being used as the gene set statistic, corresponds to a two-sided, two-sample t-test with equal variances.
If the rank sum is being used as the gene set statistic, this corresponds to a two-sided,
two-sample z-test based on the standardized rank sum statistic. NOTE: both of these tests incorrectly assume the gene-level statistics are i.i.d. 
and should therefore only be used for comparative purposes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "cor.adj.parametric": Tests statistical significance of the standardized and correlation-adjusted gene set statistic using a two-sided t-test or z-test.  
Similar to the CAMERA method by Wu et al., standardization of either the mean different statistic or rank sum statistic is performed   
using a variation inflation factor based on the average pair-wise correlation between the gene-level statistics for members of the gene set. 
Per Barry et al., this is approximated by the average correlation between the genomic variables. 
Per Wu et al., the significance of the correlation-adjusted t-statistic is tested using a two-sided t-test with n-2 df and 
the significance of the correlation-adjusted rank sum z-statistic is tested using a two-sided z-test. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "permutation": Tests gene set enrichment via the permutation distribution of the gene set statistic.
The permutation distribution is computed via permutation of the sample labels, which, in this case, is equivalent to permutation 
of the elements of the target PC. This test is realized using the safe() function from the R safe package.
The number of permutations is controlled by the "nperm" parameter. The gene.statistic cannot be set to "loadings" with this option.
Per Barry et al., this correlation is approximated by the average correlation between the genomic variables.
This option can be extremely computationally expensive so should not be used for most applications.
