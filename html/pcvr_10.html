<h2>Combine Draws From brms Models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Helper function for binding draws from several <code>brms</code> models to make a data.frame
for use with <code>brms::hypothesis()</code>. This will also check that the draws are comparable using
basic model metrics.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">combineDraws(..., message = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Some number of brmsfit objects and/or dataframes of draws
(should generally be the same type of model fit to different data)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>message</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical, should messages about possible problems be printed? Default is TRUE.
This will warn if models may not have converged, if there are different numbers of draws in
the objects, or if models have different formulations.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a dataframe of posterior draws.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># note that this example will fit several bayesian models and may run for several minutes.
