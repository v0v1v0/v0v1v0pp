<h2>Create vcf string for all SNPs in multiple loci</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a string with the information for all SNPs across multiple loci. The
information is coded as R,A:DP. R is the number of reads of the reference
allele, A is the number of reads of the alternative allele and DP is the
total depth of coverage. Each entry of the character string corresponds to a
different SNP and each entry of the list to a different locus.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">vcfloci(reference, alternative, total)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reference</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a list where each entry corresponds to a different locus.
Each list entry is a vector with the number of reads with the reference
allele. Each entry of the vector corresponds to a different SNP.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alternative</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a list where each entry corresponds to a different
locus. Each list entry is a vector with the number of reads with the
alternative allele. Each entry of the vector corresponds to a different
SNP.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>total</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a list where each entry corresponds to a different locus.
Each list entry is a vector with the total number of reads observed at each
SNP. Each entry of the vector corresponds to a different SNP.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>is a list where each entry corresponds to a different locus. Each
entry of the list is a character vector with as many entries as the number
of SNPs in the locus. Each entry of this character vector contains the
information for a single SNP coded as R,A:DP.
