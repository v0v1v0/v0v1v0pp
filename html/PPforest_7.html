<h2>Lymphoma data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Gene expression in the three most prevalent adult lymphoid malignancies: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and diffuse large B-cell lym- phoma (DLBCL). Gene expression levels were measured using a specialized cDNA microarray, the Lymphochip, containing genes that are preferentially expressed in lymphoid cells or that are of known immunologic or oncologic importance. This data set contain 80 observations from 3 lymphoma types.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Type Class variable has 3 classes with 29 cases of B-cell ALL (B-CLL), 42 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 9 cases of follicular lymphoma (FL).
