<h2>Compute expected heterozygosity within a population</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This functions calculates the value of the expected heterozygosity for each
SNP.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Expected_Het(Pop_Pi)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Pop_Pi</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a matrix or list of allele frequencies. When dealing with a
single locus, this input is a matrix and when dealing with multiple loci it
is a list. Each entry of that list is a matrix representing a different
locus. Each row of that matrix should correspond to a different population
and each column to a different SNP.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>if the input is a single matrix, the output will be a matrix where
each row represents a different population and each column is the expected
heterozygosity of a population at that site. If the input is a list, the
output will also be a list, with each entry corresponding to a different
locus. Each of those entries will be a matrix with different populations in
different rows and the expected heterozygosity of different sites at
different columns.
