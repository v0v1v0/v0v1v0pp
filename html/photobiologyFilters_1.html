<h2>photobiologyFilters: Spectral Transmittance and Spectral Reflectance Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><img src="../help/figures/logo.png" style="float: right" alt="logo" width="120"></p>
<p>Spectral 'transmittance' data for frequently used filters and similar materials. Plastic sheets and films; photography filters; theatrical gels; machine-vision filters; various types of window glass; optical glass and some laboratory plastics and glassware. Spectral reflectance data for frequently encountered materials. Part of the 'r4photobiology' suite, Aphalo P. J. (2015) <a href="https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2015.1.14">doi:10.19232/uv4pb.2015.1.14</a>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package contains transmission spectra for different types of
optical filters and filter-like objects. These spectral data are NOT
normalized. In most cases they have been obtained from sheets of the
standard thickness supplied by sellers. Metadata is stored together with
the spectral data, when available, it includes thickness, an approximate
estimate of <code>Rfr</code> (contribution of reflectance) and whether
attenuation by the filter is based on reflection, absorption or both.
Beware that when attenuation is by absorption in the body of the filter,
thickness has a strong effect on the wavelengths at which Tfr = 0.5 is
reached for a given material. Be also aware that some of the data are for
total transmittance and some for internal transmittance. Depending on the
type of filter, spectral transmittance depends more or less strongly on the
angle of incidence of radiation. All measurements included have been done
with a angle of incidence that deviates at most by a 10 degrees from zero
(light beam perpendicular to the surface of the filter). Additional data is
provided in the documentation for different objects, and metadata is also
stored as attributes in the individual spectral objects. When metadata are
available, estimates of spectral transmittance for different thicknesses
can be approximately computed for filters based on ionic or absorptive
glass or plastic. The same is true for the conversion between total and
internal transmittance if <code>Rfr</code> is available. There are also filters
based on surface reflection or absorptive layers on the surface or encased.
Some filters even use a combination of these approaches.
</p>
<p>Total spectral transmittance for climate screens used in agriculture and
horticulture is also included.
</p>
<p>In addition to transmittance for semitransparent materials, the package
also contains data on the refractive index as a function of wavelength, for
several different materials. These data allow the estimation of spectral
reflectance for these materials.
</p>
<p>Spectral reflectance data is included for several common metals and for
natural and man-made surfaces (relevant to remote sensing).
</p>
<p>Transmittance data are included for:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The whole catalogue of Schott optical filters (official data
supplied by Schott for inclussion in this package).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Most of the catalogue of MIDOPT filters (official data
extracted from dowloaded files from supplier, reproduced with permission).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Clear glass as used in windows (as used by CIE, from data file
downloaded from CIE's server.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Several types of Plexiglas from Evonik measured at our lab.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Other types of plastic sheets supplied by Foiltek Oy and Etola Oy,
measured at our lab.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Plastic films from McDermit and Courtaulds,
measured at our lab.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Several types of theatrical 'gels' from Lee, Rosco, and Formmatt.
Some measured at our lab and others data digitized from manufacturers'
catalogues.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Films used as greenhouse cladding from  BPI Agri/Visqueen,
XL-horticulture and generic, measured at our lab.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Various filters used in UV, VIS and IR imaging and photography.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Warning!</h3>

<p>Except for those from Schott and MIDOPT, none of the
spectral data included in this package are "official" specifications. In
all cases data are only for information, as even suppliers refer to the
data provided as typical. Spectral transmittance depends on the measurement
conditions, and, even more importantly, among individual production batches
of filter materials. Spectral specifications are usually given as reference
values. Both glass and plastic filters also age: their spectral properties
change as a result of exposure to radiation or the gases in the atmosphere.
Aging is in some cases fast. Another point to keep in mind is that some
filter suppliers, for example Rosco, have changed the spectral
transmittance of some filters over the years without changing the code or
name under which they are sold. In other words, the data provided here are
not a substitute for actual measurements of transmission spectra of the
filters actually used in a given piece of scientific research. For less
demanding situations the data are in most cases useful, but good
agreement with measurements on other batches of filters of the same exact
type should not be expected, specially for materials not intended to be
used as optical filters.
