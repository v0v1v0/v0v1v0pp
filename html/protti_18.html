<h2>Calculate differential abundance between conditions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated"><img src="../help/figures/lifecycle-deprecated.svg" alt="[Deprecated]"></a>
This function was deprecated due to its name changing to <code>calculate_diff_abundance()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">diff_abundance(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame that contains differential abundances (<code>diff</code>), p-values (<code>pval</code>)
and adjusted p-values (<code>adj_pval</code>) for each protein, peptide or precursor (depending on
the <code>grouping</code> variable) and the associated treatment/reference pair. Depending on the
method the data frame contains additional columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> "t-test": The <code>std_error</code> column contains the standard error of the differential
abundances. <code>n_obs</code> contains the number of observations for the specific protein, peptide
or precursor (depending on the <code>grouping</code> variable) and the associated treatment/reference pair.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "t-test_mean_sd": Columns labeled as control refer to the second condition of the
comparison pairs. Treated refers to the first condition. <code>mean_control</code> and <code>mean_treated</code>
columns contain the means for the reference and treatment condition, respectively. <code>sd_control</code>
and <code>sd_treated</code> columns contain the standard deviations for the reference and treatment
condition, respectively. <code>n_control</code> and <code>n_treated</code> columns contain the numbers of
samples for the reference and treatment condition, respectively. The <code>std_error</code> column
contains the standard error of the differential abundances. <code>t_statistic</code> contains the
t_statistic for the t-test.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "moderated_t-test": <code>CI_2.5</code> and <code>CI_97.5</code> contain the 2.5% and 97.5%
confidence interval borders for differential abundances. <code>avg_abundance</code> contains average
abundances for treatment/reference pairs (mean of the two group means). <code>t_statistic</code>
contains the t_statistic for the t-test. <code>B</code> The B-statistic is the log-odds that the
protein, peptide or precursor (depending on <code>grouping</code>) has a differential abundance
between the two groups. Suppose B=1.5. The odds of differential abundance is exp(1.5)=4.48, i.e,
about four and a half to one. The probability that there is a differential abundance is
4.48/(1+4.48)=0.82, i.e., the probability is about 82% that this group is differentially
abundant. A B-statistic of zero corresponds to a 50-50 chance that the group is differentially
abundant.<code>n_obs</code> contains the number of observations for the specific protein, peptide or
precursor (depending on the <code>grouping</code> variable) and the associated treatment/reference pair.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "proDA": The <code>std_error</code> column contains the standard error of the differential
abundances. <code>avg_abundance</code> contains average abundances for treatment/reference pairs
(mean of the two group means). <code>t_statistic</code> contains the t_statistic for the t-test.
<code>n_obs</code> contains the number of observations for the specific protein, peptide or precursor
(depending on the <code>grouping</code> variable) and the associated treatment/reference pair.
