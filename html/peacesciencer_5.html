<h2>Add Correlates of War direct contiguity information to a data frame</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_contiguity()</code> allows you to add Correlates of War contiguity
data to a dyad-year, leader-year, or leader-dyad-year, or state-year data frame.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_contiguity(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with appropriate <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> attributes</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The contiguity codes in the dyad-year data range from 0 to 5.
1 = direct land contiguity. 2 = separated by 12 miles of water or
fewer (a la Stannis Baratheon). 3 = separated by 24 miles of water or
fewer (but more than 12 miles). 4 = separated by 150 miles
of water or fewer (but more than 24 miles). 5 = separated by 400 miles
of water or fewer (but more than 150 miles).
</p>
<p>Importantly, 0 are the dyads that are not contiguous at all in the CoW contiguity data.
This is a conscious decision on my part as I do not think of the CoW's contiguity data
as exactly ordinal. Cross-reference CoW's contiguity data with the minimum distance
data in this exact package to see how some dyads that CoW codes as not contiguous are
in fact very close to each other, sometimes even land-contiguous. For example, Zimbabwe and
Namibia are separated by only about a few hundred feet of water at that peculiar intersection of
the Zambezi River where the borders of Zambia, Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe meet. There is
no contiguity record for this in the CoW data. There are other cases where contiguity records
are situationally missing (e.g. India-Bangladesh, and Bangladesh-Myanmar in 1971) or other cases where
states are much closer than CoW's contiguity data imply (e.g. Pakistan and the Soviet Union were separated by
under 30 kilometers of Afghani territory). The researcher is free to recode these 0s to be, say, 6s, but this
is why <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> does not do this.
</p>
<p>For additional clarity, the "master records" produce duplicates for cases when
the contiguity relationship changed in a given year. This function returns the
<em>minimum</em> contiguity relationship observed in that given year. There should be no
duplicates in the returned output.
</p>
<p>Be mindful that the data are fundamentally state-year and that extensions to
leader-level data should be understood as approximations for leaders in a
given state-year.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_contiguity()</code> takes a data frame and adds information
about the contiguity relationship based on the "master records" for the
Correlates of War direct contiguity data (v. 3.2). If the data are dyad-year
(or leader dyad-year), the function returns the lowest contiguity type
observed in the dyad-year (if contiguity is observed at all). If the data
are state-year (or leader-year), the data return the total number of
land and sea borders calculated from these master records.
