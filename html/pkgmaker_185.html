<h2>User Data Directory
<code>userData</code> returns the path to a local directory/file where package-related user data can be stored.
Note that a base directory is <strong>always</strong> created if necessary (see details).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package-specific user data base directory is the sub-directory <em>R-data/</em>,
located in the user's home or within a diredctory defined by global option 'userData.path'.
</p>
<p>If in interactive mode, and the base directory does not exist yet,
the user is asked if it should be created in his home directory.
Otherwise, or if the user does not allow the creation in his home, this directory is created
in the current R session's temporary directory.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">userData(..., create = NULL, package = topenv(parent.frame()))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>path parts passed to <code>file.path</code> to be appended to
the main path.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>create</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical that indicates if the <strong>base</strong> directory should be
created if it does not exists.
</p>
<p>Note that directories – and files – under the base directory are not automatically
created. The user should therefore care of it in the caller function if necessary.
</p>
<p>If <code>create=TRUE</code>, then the base directory is forced to be created in the user's home directory.
If <code>create=FALSE</code>, then the base directory is never created.
</p>
