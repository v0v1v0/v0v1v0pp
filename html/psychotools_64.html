<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A survey was conducted at the Department of Psychology, Universität
Tübingen, in June 2009. The sample was stratified by gender and age (younger
versus older than 30 years) with 48 participants in each group.  The
interviewers were Psychology Master's students who collected the data for
course credits.
</p>
<p>Participants were presented with 15 pairs of boys names in random order. On
each trial, their task was to choose the name they would rather give to
their own child.  The pairs of boys names were read to the participants one
at a time.  A given participant compared each pair in one order only, hence
the NA's in <code>ordered.pref</code>.
</p>
<p>The names were selected to fall within the upper (Tim, Lucas), mid (Michael,
Robin) and lower (Benedikt, Julius) range of the top 100 of the most popular
boys names in Germany in the years from 1990 to 1999
(<a href="https://www.beliebte-vornamen.de/3778-1990er-jahre.htm">https://www.beliebte-vornamen.de/3778-1990er-jahre.htm</a>). The names
have either front (e, i) or back (o, u) vowels in the stressed syllables.
Phonology of the name and attractiveness of a person have been shown to be
related (Perfors, 2004; Hartung et al., 2009).
