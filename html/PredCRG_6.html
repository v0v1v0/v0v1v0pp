Training dataset of the PredCRG model.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The dataset that has been used to train the PredCRG model contains four sub-datasets (Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4) which are prepared based on the homogeneity of sequence length. The positive sets of the sub-datasets are denoted as pos_Q1, pos_Q2, pos_Q3 and pos_Q4 respectively, whereas the negative sets as neg_Q1, neg_Q2, neg_Q3 and neq_Q4 respectively. Further, same number of sequences are there in both positive and negative sets in each sub-dataset. More clearly, 1588, 1596, 1593 and 1365 sequences are present for both positive and negative sets for Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 sub-datasets respectively. Further, the range of the length of the sequences for pos_Q1, pos_Q2, pos_Q3 and pos_Q4 are 39-221, 221-363, 363-538, 538-1000 amino acids respectively, and the range of the length of the sequences for neg_Q1, neg_Q2, neg_Q3 and neg_Q4 are 43-407, 407-485, 485-607 and 607-1000 amino acids respectively. In this dataset, only the Q1 sub-dataset is available due to constraint of space in CRAN. However, one can get all the four sub-datasets from GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/meher861982/PredCRG_dataset">https://github.com/meher861982/PredCRG_dataset</a> ).

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("PredCRG_data")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The datasets are in <code>AAStringSet</code> format, which can be obtained by reading the FASTA file using <code>readAAStringSet</code> function availbale in <b><code>Biostrings</code></b> package.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The protein sequences encoded by the circadian genes contitutes the positive datasets, whereas a randomly selected dataset from the <b>Uniprot</b> for the clad <em>Viridi plantae</em> constitutes the negative dataset.
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The circadian gene sequecnces are collected from the circadian gene database accessible at <a href="http://cgdb.biocuckoo.org/">http://cgdb.biocuckoo.org/</a> .
