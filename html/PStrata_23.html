<h2>Create an object that defines the principal strata</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>PStrataInfo</code> is a class of object that defines all principal strata
to be considered, by specifying the potential value of each post-randomization
confounding variable under each treatment arm.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">PStrataInfo(strata, ER = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>strata</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list or a vector defining all principal strata. Details of
the syntax are given in 'Details' below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ER</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector indicating on which strata exclusion restriction is assumed. Details are
given in 'Details' below.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Since definition of the principal strata appears fundamental and essential in 
principal stratification analyses, the creation of such an object is designed
to be user-friendly - various ways are accommodated to create a <code>PStrataInfo</code>
object, some possibly preferable over others under different settings.
</p>
<p>There are mainly two ways to easily create a <code>PStrataInfo</code> object.
</p>


<h4>By string</h4>

<p>To define the principal strata by strings, the <code>strata</code> argument
should receive a named vector, each component being the description of one strata
with the name of that strata. The naming does not affect the actual inference,
but informative names can be helpful for users to distinguish among strata.
</p>
<p>Each stratum is defined by the potential values of the post-randomization confounding
variable <code class="reqn">D</code> under each treatment arm. By convention, assume that the K treatment arms are
numbered from 0 to K-1. Then, each stratum is defined by the tuple <code class="reqn">(D(0), \ldots, D(K-1))</code>,
which can be written compactly as a string. For example, under binary treatment,
the never-takers (i.e. <code class="reqn">D(0) = D(1) = 0</code>) can be represented by string <code>"00"</code> and 
the compliers (i.e. <code class="reqn">D(0) = 0, D(1) = 1</code>) can be represented by string <code>"01"</code>.
Note that the value that the post-randomization confounding variable can take is limited between 0 to 9
for the string to be parsed correctly. This should be more than enough in most of the applications, and
in cases where a number above 10 is needed, please create the <code>PStrataInfo</code> object by matrix (see below).
</p>
<p>When multiple post-randomization confounding variables exist, the string for each confounding variable
is concatenated with the symbol "<code>|</code>". For example, if <code class="reqn">D_0</code> and <code class="reqn">D_1</code> are both binary 
post-randomization confounding variables, the stratum defined by <code class="reqn">D_0(0) = D_0(1) = 0, D_1(0) = 0, D_1(1) = 1</code>
can be represented by string <code>"00|11"</code>. The order of these confounding variables should be the same
as they appear in the <code>S.formula</code> parameter in <code>PSObject</code>.
</p>
<p>A common assumption in practice is the exclusion restriction (ER) assumption, which assumes that 
the causal effect of the treatment on the outcome is totally realized through the post-randomization 
confounding variables. For example, the ER assumption on the stratum of never-takers can be interpreted
as the outcome is identically distributed across the treated and control group, because all causal effect
of the treatment is realized through the post-randomization variable, which is the same (0) under both 
treatment arms. To assume ER for some stratum, simply put an asterisk "<code>*</code>" at the end of the string,
such as "00*" for the never-taker stratum. <em>Note that under the context of multiple post-randomization
variables, the package treats all such variables as a unity. The outcome is assumed to be identical under
different treatment arms only when all post-randomization variables remain the same under these treatment arms.</em>
</p>
<p>Another way to specify the stratum where ER is assumed is to use the <code>ER</code> argument. It either takes
a logical vector of the same length of <code>strata</code> with <code>TRUE</code> indicating ER is assumed and <code>FALSE</code>
otherwise, or takes a character vector with the names of all strata where ER is to be assumed upon.
When names to the strata are not provided in <code>strata</code>, the strata can be referred to by their 
canonical name, which is the string used to define the stratum with asterisks removed. For example, 
the strata <code>"00|11*"</code> can be referred to with name "00|11".
</p>



<h4>By matrix</h4>

<p>To define the principal strata by matrices, the <code>strata</code> argument
should receive a named list, each component being a matrix. The number of rows matches the number
of post-randomization variables, and the number of columns matches that of possible treatment arms.
For any fixed row <code class="reqn">i</code>, column <code class="reqn">j</code> stores the potential value of the <code class="reqn">i</code>-th post-randomization
variable under treatment arm <code class="reqn">j</code>.
</p>
<p>When this approach is used, there is no shorthand to specify ER assumption. The <code>ER</code> argument is 
required to do this.
</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> When ER assumption is specified in both <code>strata</code> and <code>ER</code> argument, the shorthand
notation for ER in <code>strata</code> is ignored, and a warning is given regardless of whether the specification
given by <code>strata</code> and <code>ER</code> actually match.
</p>
