<h2>Calculate Peak RAM Used</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function monitors the total and peak RAM used by any number of
R expressions or functions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">peakRAM(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>R expressions or function calls. Anonymous functions
(e.g., <code>function() 1:1e7</code>) also accepted.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When working with big datasets, RAM conservation is critically
important. However, it is not always enough to just monitor the
size of the objects created. So-called "copy-on-modify" behavior,
characteristic of R, means that some expressions or functions may
require an unexpectedly large amount of RAM overhead. For example,
replacing a single value in a matrix (e.g., with <code>'[&lt;-'</code>)
duplicates that matrix in the backend, making this task
require twice as much RAM as that used by the matrix itself.
The <code>peakRAM</code> package makes it easy to monitor the total
and peak RAM used so that developers can quickly identify and
eliminate RAM hungry code.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>data.frame</code> tallying total and peak RAM use.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">peakRAM(function() 1:1e7,
        1:1e7,
        1:1e7 + 1:1e7,
        1:1e7 * 2)
</code></pre>
