<h2>projects folder path</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns the file path of the main projects folder if it has been established
via <code>setup_projects()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">projects_folder()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The file path is returned as a simple character string. It simply returns the
value of <code>Sys.getenv("PROJECTS_FOLDER_PATH")</code>, provided
that its value is a file path of a directory that actually exists (i.e.,
<code>setup_projects()</code> has been successfully run).
</p>
<p>If it can't find a directory with that path, it returns this string:
</p>
<p><code>projects folder not found. Please run setup_projects()</code>
</p>
