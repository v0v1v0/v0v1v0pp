<h2>A bootstrap aggregation function for choosing most predictive unit weighted items</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>bestScales</code> forms scales from the items/scales most correlated with a particular criterion and then cross validates on a hold out sample using unit weighted scales.  This may be repeated n.iter times using either basic bootstrap aggregation (bagging) techniques or K-fold cross validation. Thus, the technique is known as <code>BISCUIT</code> (Best Items Scales that are Cross validated, Unit weighted, Informative, and Transparent).  Given a dictionary of item content, <code>bestScales</code> will sort by criteria correlations and display the item content. Options for bagging (bootstrap aggregation) are included. An alternative to unit weighting is to weight items by their zero order correlations (cross validated) with the criteria. This weighted version is called <code>BISCWIT</code> and is an optional output. 
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are a number of procedures that can be used for predicting criteria from a set of predictors.  The generic term for this is "machine learning" or "statistical learning".  The basic logic of these procedures is to find a set of items that best predict a criteria according to some fit statistic and then cross validate these items numerous times.  "lasso" regression (least absolute shrinkage and selection) is one such example. <code>bestScales</code> differs from these procedures by unit weighting items chosen from their zero order correlations with the criteria rather than weighting the partial correlations ala regression.  This is an admittedly simple procedure that takes into account the well known finding (Wilks, 1938;  Wainer, 1976; Dawes, 1979; Waller, 2008) that although regression weights are optimal for any particular data set, unit weights are almost as good (fungible) and more robust across sample variation.  
</p>
<p>Following some suggestions, we have added the ability to find scales where items are weighted by their zero order correlations with the criteria.   This is effectively a comprimise between unit weighting and regression weights (where the weights are the zero order correlations times the inverse of the correlation matrix). This weighted version may be thought of as <code>BISCWIT</code> in contrast to the unit weighted version <code>BISCUIT</code>.
</p>
<p>To be comparable to other ML algorithms, we now consider multiple solutions (for number of items &gt;= min.item to max.item).  The final scale consists of the number  items which maximize  the validity or at least are within delta * standard error of r of the maximum.  
</p>
<p>Thus, <code>bestScales</code> will find up to n.items per criterion that have absolute correlations with a criterion greater than cut.  If the overlap option is FALSE (default) the other criteria are not used.  This is an example of â€œdust bowl empiricism" in that there is no latent construct being measured, just those items that most correlate with a set of criteria. The empirically identified items are then formed into scales (ignoring concepts of internal consistency) which are then correlated with the criteria.  
</p>
<p>Clearly, <code>bestScales</code> is capitalizing on chance associations.  Thus, we should validate the empirical scales by deriving them on a fraction of the total number of subjects, and cross validating on the remaining subjects. (This is known both as K-fold cross validation and bagging.  Both may be done).  If folds &gt; 1, then a k-fold cross validation is done.  This removes 1/k (a fold) from the sample for the derivation sample and validates on that remaining fold. This is done k-folds times.  Traditional cross validation would thus be a k-fold with k =2.  More modern applications seem to prefer k =10 to have 90% derivation sample and a 10% cross validation sample.
</p>
<p>The alternative, known as 'bagging' is to do a bootstrap sample (which because it is sampling with replacement will typically extract 1- 1/e = 63.2% of the sample) for the derivation sample (the bag) and then validate it on the remaining 1/e of the sample (the out of bag).  This is done n.iter times. This should be repeated multiple times (n.iter &gt; 1, e.g. n.iter=1000) to get stable cross validations.
</p>
<p>One can compare the validity of these two approaches by  trying each.  The average predictability of the n.iter samples are shown as are the average validity of the cross validations.   This can only be done if x is a data matrix/ data.frame, not a correlation matrix.  For very large data sets (e.g., those from SAPA) these scales seem very stable. 
</p>
<p><code>bestScales</code> is effectively a straight forward application of 'bagging' (bootstrap aggregation) and machine learning as well as k-fold validation. 
</p>
<p>The criteria can be the colnames of elements of x, or can be a separate data.frame. 
</p>
<p><code>bestItems</code> and <code>lookup</code> are simple helper functions to summarize correlation matrices or factor loading matrices.  <code>bestItems</code> will sort the specified column (criteria) of x on the basis of the (absolute) value of the column.  The return as a default is just the rowname of the variable with those absolute values &gt; cut.   If there is a dictionary of item content and item names, then include the contents as a two column matrix with rownames corresponding to the item name and then as many fields as desired for item content. (See the example dictionary <code>bfi.dictionary</code>).
</p>
<p>The derived model can be further validated against yet another hold out sample using the <code>predict.psych</code> function if given the best scale object and the new data set. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>bestScales</code> returns the correlation of the empirically constructed scale with each criteria and the items used in the scale.  If a dictionary is specified, it also returns a list (value) that shows the item content. Also returns the keys.list so that scales can be found using <code>cluster.cor</code> or <code>scoreItems</code>.  If using replications (bagging or kfold) then it also returns the best.keys, a list suitable for scoring.
</p>
<p>There are actually four keys lists reported.
</p>
<p>best.keys are all the items used to form unit weighted scales with the restriction of n.item.  
</p>
<p>weights may be used in the <code>scoreWtd</code> function to find scales based upon the raw correlation weights.
</p>
<p>If the min.item and max.item options are used, then two more sets of weights are provided.
</p>
<p>optimal.keys are a subset of the best.keys, taking just those items that increase the cross validation values up to the delta * se of the maximum.  This is a slightly more parsimonious set.
</p>
<p>optimal.weights is analogous to optimal keys, but for supplies weights for just those items that are used to predict cross validation values up to delta * se of the maximum.
</p>
<p>The best.keys object is a list of items (with keying information) that may be used in subsequent analyses.  These â€œbest.keys" are formed into scale scores for the â€œfinal.valid" object which reports how well the best.keys work on the entire sample.  This is, of course, not cross validated.  Further cross validation can be done using the <code>predict.psych</code> function.

<p><code>bestItems</code> returns a sorted list of factor loadings or correlations with the labels as provided in the dictionary. If given raw data, then the correlations with the criteria variables are found first according to "use" and "method".
</p>
<p>The stats object can be used to create <code>error.dots</code> plots to show the mean estimate and the standard error of the estimates.   See  the examples.
</p>
<p>The resulting best scales can be cross validated on a different hold out sample using <code>crossValidation</code>.  See the last example. 
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Although <code>bestScales</code> was designed to form the best unit weighted scales, for large data sets, there seems to be some additional information in weighting by the average zero-order correlation. 
</p>
<p>To create a dictionary, create an object with row names as the item numbers, and the columns as the item content.  See the <code>link{bfi.dictionary}</code> as an example.
</p>
<p>This is a very computationally intensive function which can be speeded up considerably by using multiple cores and using the parallel package. The number of cores to use when doing bestScales may be specified using the options command. The greatest step in speed is going from 1 core to 2. This is about a 50
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Although empirical scale construction is appealing, it has the basic problem of capitalizing on chance.  Thus, be careful of over interpreting the results unless working with large samples.  Iteration and bootstrapping aggregation (bagging) gives information on the stability of the solutions.
</p>
<p>It is also important to realize that the variables that are most related to the criterion might be because of other, trivial reasons (e.g. height predicts gender)
