<h2>Example 16â€“Inverse Modeling of Sierra Spring Waters</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This example repeats the inverse modeling calculations of the
chemical evolution of spring-water compositions in the Sierra Nevada that
are described in a classic paper by Garrels and Mackenzie (1967). The same
example is described in the manual for the inverse-modeling program NETPATH
(Plummer and others, 1991 and 1994). The example uses two spring-water
compositions, one from an ephemeral spring, which is less chemically
evolved, and one from a perennial spring, which probably has had a longer
residence time in the subsoil. The differences in composition between the
ephemeral spring and the perennial spring are assumed to be caused by
reactions between the water and the minerals and gases it contacts. The
object of inverse modeling in this example is to find sets of minerals and
gases that, when reacted in appropriate amounts, account for the differences
in composition between the two solutions. The example can be run using the
<code>phrRunString</code> routine.
