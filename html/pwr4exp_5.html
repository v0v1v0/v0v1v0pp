<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>treatments</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer-valued vector specifying the treatment structure,
in which the length of the vector indicates the number of treatment factors,
and each value represents the number of levels for each factor. A maximum of
two factors is allowed, and they are arranged in a factorial design.
For instance, <code>treatments = n</code> specifies one treatment factor with n
levels, and <code>treatments=c(2,3)</code> creates a "2x3" factorial design of
two treatment factors with 2 and 3 levels, respectively.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>label</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional. A list of character vectors specifying the names of
treatment factors and factor levels. Each vector in the list represents a
treatment factor, where the name of the vector specifies the name of the
factor, and the values in the vector are the labels for that factor's levels.
If not provided, factors and levels for one and two treatment factors are
labeled as <code>list(trt = c("1", "2", ...))</code> and
<code>list(facA = c("1", "2", ...), facB = c("1", "2", ...))</code>, respectively.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>replicates</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of experimental units per treatment in a completely
randomized design or the number of experimental units (main plots) per treatment
of main plot factors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>A model formula for testing treatment effects in
post-experimental data analysis. Use the syntax of <code>lm</code> for fixed
effects and lmer for random effects. The response variable is
always denoted as <code>y</code>. By default, all interaction terms between treatment
factors are included in the formula.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>beta</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector of expected model coefficients, representing the
effect sizes. The first element represents the intercept term, corresponding
to the mean of the reference level for categorical variables. Subsequent
elements correspond to the effect sizes of the independent variables in the
order they appear in the model matrix. For categorical variables, each coefficient
represents the difference between a non-reference level and the reference level
(intercept), as <code>contr.treatment</code> contrast coding is used for
constructing the model matrix. Ensure that <code>beta</code> aligns with the columns of the
model matrix, including any dummy variables created for categorical predictors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sigma2</code></td>
<td>
<p>error variance.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>blocks</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of blocks.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>VarCov</code></td>
<td>
<p>Variance-covariance components of random effects. For multiple
random effect groups, supply the variance (for a single random effect term)
or variance-covariance matrix (for two or more random effect terms) of each
group in a list, following the order in the model formula.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional arguments passed to the <code>anova</code> function in
<code>lmerTest</code>. The type of ANOVA table (default is Type III) and the method
for computing denominator degrees of freedom (default is Satterthwaite's method)
can be modified. For balanced designs, the choice of sum of squares (SS) and
degrees of freedom (df) does not affect the results.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>squares</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of replicated squares. By default, 1, i.e., no
replicated squares.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reuse</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string specifying how to replicate squares when
there are multiple squares. Options are: "row" for reusing row blocks, "col"
for reusing column blocks, or "both" for reusing both row and column blocks
to replicate a single square.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trt.main</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer-valued vector specifying the treatment structure at
main plot level for a split plot design, similar to <code>treatments</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trt.sub</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer-valued vector specifying the treatment structure at
sub plot level for a split plot design, similar to <code>treatments</code>.</p>

<p>Required input for creating a customized design. A data frame
with all independent variables of the design as columns, representing the actual
data structure (long format data frame) without response variables.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>design.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional input for creating a customized design. A character.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each function creates a specific design as described below:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>designCRD</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Completely Randomized Design.
By default, the model formula is <code>y ~ trt</code> for one factor and
<code>y ~ facA*facB</code> for two factors, unless explicitly specified. If the
<code>label</code> argument is provided, the formula is automatically updated with the
specified treatment factor names.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>designRCBD</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Randomized Complete Block Design.
The default model formula is <code>y ~ trt + (1|block)</code> for one factor and
<code>y ~ facA*facB + (1|block)</code> for two factors. If <code>label</code> is provided, the
fixed effect parts of the formula are automatically updated with the specified
names. The label of block factor ("block") in the formula is not changeable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>designLSD</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Latin Square Design.
The default formula is <code>y ~ trt + (1|row) + (1|col)</code> for one factor and
<code>y ~ facA*facB + (1|row) + (1|col)</code> for two factors. If <code>label</code> is provided,
the fixed effect parts of the formula are automatically updated with the specified
names. The labels of row ("row") and column ("col") block factors are not changeable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>designCOD</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Crossover Design, which is a special case of LSD
with time periods and individuals as blocks. Period blocks are reused when
replicating squares.
The default formula is <code>y ~ trt + (1|subject) + (1|period)</code> for one factor
and <code>y ~ facA*facB + (1|subject) + (1|period)</code> for two factors. If <code>label</code>
is provided, the fixed effect parts of the formula are automatically updated
with the specified names. Note that "subject" and "period" are the labels for
the two blocking factors and cannot be changed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>designSPD</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Split Plot Design.
The default formula includes the main effects of all treatment factors at
both the main and sub-plot levels, their interactions, and the random effects
of main plots: <code>y ~ . + (1|mainplot)</code>. If <code>label</code> is provided, the fixed
effect parts of the formula are automatically updated with the specified names.
The experimental unit at the main plot level (i.e., the block factor at the
subplot level) is always denoted as "mainplot".</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>designCustom</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Customized Design.</p>
</dd>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Example 1: Evaluate the power of a CRD with one treatment factor

## Create a design object

crd &lt;- designCRD(
  treatments = 4, # 4 levels of one treatment factor
  replicates = 12, # 12 units per level, 48 units totally
  # mean of level1, and the means of other levels minus level1, respectively
  beta = c(30, -2, 3, 5),
  sigma2 = 10 # error variance
)

## power of omnibus test
pwr.anova(crd)

## power of contrast
pwr.contrast(crd, specs = "trt", method = "pairwise") # pairwise comparisons
pwr.contrast(crd, specs = "trt", method = "poly") # polynomial contrasts

# Example 2: Evaluate the power of an RCBD with 2 x 2 factorial treatments

# Treatment factors are A (A1 vs. A2) and B (B1 vs. B2).
# To illustrate how to provide `beta`, treatment means are presented:
#     B1  B2
# A1  20  24
# A2  17  22
#
# From these means, we calculate:
# 1. the mean of reference level (A1B1): 20
# 2. the effect of A2 alone: Effect_A2 = A2B1 - A1B1 = 17 - 20 = -3
# 3. the effect of B2 alone: Effect_A2 = A1B2 - A1B1 = 24 - 20 = 4
# 4. the interaction effect of A2 and B2:
#    Interaction_A2B2 = A2B2 - A2B1 - A1B2 + A1B1 = 22 - 17 - 24 + 20 = 1, representing
#    the additional effect of combining A2B2 compared to what would be expected
#    from the sum of individual effects of A2 and B2.

# The `beta` vector is constructed as:
# beta = c(mean_A1B1, Effect_A2, Effect_B2, Interaction_A2B2)
# beta = c(20, -3, 4, 1)

## Create a design object

rcbd &lt;- designRCBD(
  # 2x2 factorial design
  treatments = c(2, 2),
  # Specify treatment names
  label = list(A = c("A1", "A2"), B = c("B1", "B2")),
  # 12 blocks, totaling 48 experimental units
  blocks = 12,
  # Mean of the reference level and effect sizes as calculated above
  beta = c(20, -3, 4, 1),
  # Variance of block effects (between-block variance)
  VarCov = 30,
  # Error variance (within-block variance)
  sigma2 = 20
)

## power of omnibus test

pwr.anova(rcbd)

## power of B2 vs. B1 at each level of A
pwr.contrast(rcbd, specs = ~B|A, method = "pairwise")
