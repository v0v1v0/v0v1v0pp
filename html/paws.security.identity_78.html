<h2>Exports a private certificate issued by a private certificate authority
(CA) for use anywhere</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Exports a private certificate issued by a private certificate authority (CA) for use anywhere. The exported file contains the certificate, the certificate chain, and the encrypted private 2048-bit RSA key associated with the public key that is embedded in the certificate. For security, you must assign a passphrase for the private key when exporting it.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/acm_export_certificate/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/acm_export_certificate/</a> for full documentation.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>CertificateArn</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the issued certificate. This must be of
the form:
</p>
<p><code>arn:aws:acm:region:account:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Passphrase</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] Passphrase to associate with the encrypted exported private key.
</p>
<p>When creating your passphrase, you can use any ASCII character except
#, $, or %.
</p>
<p>If you want to later decrypt the private key, you must have the
passphrase. You can use the following OpenSSL command to decrypt a
private key. After entering the command, you are prompted for the
passphrase.
</p>
<p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠openssl rsa -in encrypted_key.pem -out decrypted_key.pem⁠</code></p>
