<h2>Writes a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Writes a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Call <code>put_record</code> to send data into the stream for real-time ingestion and subsequent processing, one record at a time. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/kinesis_put_record/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/kinesis_put_record/</a> for full documentation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">kinesis_put_record(
  StreamName = NULL,
  Data,
  PartitionKey,
  ExplicitHashKey = NULL,
  SequenceNumberForOrdering = NULL,
  StreamARN = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>StreamName</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the stream to put the data record into.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Data</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The data blob to put into the record, which is base64-encoded when the
blob is serialized. When the data blob (the payload before
base64-encoding) is added to the partition key size, the total size must
not exceed the maximum record size (1 MiB).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>PartitionKey</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] Determines which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to.
Partition keys are Unicode strings with a maximum length limit of 256
characters for each key. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams uses the partition
key as input to a hash function that maps the partition key and
associated data to a specific shard. Specifically, an MD5 hash function
is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map
associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing
mechanism, all data records with the same partition key map to the same
shard within the stream.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ExplicitHashKey</code></td>
<td>
<p>The hash value used to explicitly determine the shard the data record is
assigned to by overriding the partition key hash.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SequenceNumberForOrdering</code></td>
<td>
<p>Guarantees strictly increasing sequence numbers, for puts from the same
client and to the same partition key. Usage: set the
<code>SequenceNumberForOrdering</code> of record <em>n</em> to the sequence number of
record <em>n-1</em> (as returned in the result when putting record <em>n-1</em>). If
this parameter is not set, records are coarsely ordered based on arrival
time.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>StreamARN</code></td>
<td>
<p>The ARN of the stream.</p>
</td>
