<h2>Used by activity workers to report to the service that the ActivityTask
represented by the specified taskToken is still making progress</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Used by activity workers to report to the service that the ActivityTask represented by the specified <code>taskToken</code> is still making progress. The worker can also specify details of the progress, for example percent complete, using the <code>details</code> parameter. This action can also be used by the worker as a mechanism to check if cancellation is being requested for the activity task. If a cancellation is being attempted for the specified task, then the boolean <code>cancelRequested</code> flag returned by the service is set to <code>true</code>.
