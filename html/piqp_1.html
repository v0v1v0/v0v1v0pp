<h2>R Interface to PIQP Solver</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>PIQP is an Proximal Interior Point Quadratic
Programming solver, which can solve dense and sparse quadratic
programs described in described in Schwan, Jiang, Kuhn, and Jones
(2023) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00290">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00290</a>). Combining an
infeasible interior point method with the proximal method of
multipliers, the algorithm can handle ill-conditioned convex QP
problems without the need for linear independence of the
constraints. The solver is written in header only 'C++ 14'
leveraging the Eigen library for vectorized linear algebra. For
small dense problems, vectorized instructions and cache locality
can be exploited more efficiently. Allocation free problem
updates and re-solves are also provided.
