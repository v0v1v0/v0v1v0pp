</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Path</code></td>
<td>
<p>The path for the user name. For more information about paths, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html">IAM identifiers</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.
</p>
<p>This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a
slash (/).
</p>
<p>This parameter allows (through its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex">regex pattern</a>) a string of characters
consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must
begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any
ASCII character from the ! (<code>U+0021</code>) through the DEL character
(<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠U+007F⁠</code>), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and
lowercased letters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>UserName</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The name of the user to create.
</p>
<p>IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the
account. Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot
create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>PermissionsBoundary</code></td>
<td>
<p>The ARN of the managed policy that is used to set the permissions
boundary for the user.
</p>
<p>A permissions boundary policy defines the maximum permissions that
identity-based policies can grant to an entity, but does not grant
permissions. Permissions boundaries do not define the maximum
permissions that a resource-based policy can grant to an entity. To
learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html">Permissions boundaries for IAM entities</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.
</p>
<p>For more information about policy types, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policy-types">Policy types</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Tags</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of tags that you want to attach to the new user. Each tag
consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information
about tagging, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html">Tagging IAM resources</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.
</p>
<p>If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum
number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not
created.</p>
