<h2>Quartet concordance factors across Arabidopsis thaliana</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Concordance factors of quartets for 29 A. thaliana accessions and A. lyrata,
obtained from chromosome 4 using MDL to delimit loci
then 
BUCKy on each 4-taxon set.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(quartetCF)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data frame with 7 variables and 27,405 rows.
Each row corresponds to one 4-taxon set
(choosing 4 taxa out of 30 makes 27,405 combinations).
The first four variables, named 'taxon1' through 'taxon4',
give the names of the 4 taxa in each 4-taxon set.
Variables 5 through 7 are named CF12.34, CF13.24 and CF14.23,
and give the estimated concordance factors of the 3 quartets on
each set of 4 taxa: taxon 1 + taxon 2 versus taxon3 + taxon 4, etc.
These concordance factors are the proportion of loci that have a
given quartet tree.
They were obtained from chromosome 4 using MDL to delimit loci
then BUCKy to estimate quartet concordance factors (CFs).
