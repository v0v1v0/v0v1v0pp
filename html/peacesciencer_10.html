<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_cow_wars()</code> allows you to Correlates of War data to a
dyad-year or state-year data frame
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Intra-state war data are coerced into true state-year data by first
selecting the duplicate state-years on unique onsets, then whichever
war was the deadliest. The inter-state war data work functionally the same way.
</p>
<p>On intra-state wars: the <code>primary_state</code> is used to identify the government
principally fighting the domestic non-state actor over central control over
local issues. Internationalized civil wars are included in the data, but not
for outside actors that intervene on behalf of the government or rebel group.
</p>
<p>Extra-state war functionality is not available right now as I try to
figure out the demand for its use.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_cow_wars()</code> takes a dyad-year or state-year data frame and
returns information about wars from either the inter-state or intra-state war
data set from the Correlates of War. The function works for state-year data
when the user wants information about extra-state wars or intra-state wars.
The function works for dyad-year data when the user wants information about
inter-state wars.
