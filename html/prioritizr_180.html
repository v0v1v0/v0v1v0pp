<h2>Add decision types</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Conservation planning problems involve making decisions on
how different planning units will be managed. These decisions might involve
turning an entire planning unit into a protected area, turning part
of a planning unit into a protected area, or allocating a planning
unit to a specific management zone. If no decision is explicitly added to a
problem, then binary decisions will be used by default.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Only a single type of decision can be added to a conservation
planning <code>problem()</code>. Note that if multiple decisions are added
to a problem, then the last one added will be used.
</p>
<p>The following decisions can be added to a conservation planning
<code>problem()</code>:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>add_binary_decisions()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Add a binary decision to a
conservation planning <code>problem</code>. This is the classic decision of
either prioritizing or not prioritizing a planning unit. Typically, this
decision has the assumed action of buying the planning unit to include
in a protected area network. If no decision is added to a problem object
then this decision class will be used by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_proportion_decisions()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Add a proportion decision to
a conservation planning <code>problem</code>. This is a relaxed decision
where a part of a planning unit can be prioritized, as opposed to the
default of the entire planning unit. Typically, this decision
has the assumed action of buying a fraction of a planning unit to
include in a protected area network.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_semicontinuous_decisions()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Add a semi-continuous
decision to a conservation planning <code>problem</code>. This decision is
similar to <code>add_proportion_decision</code> except that it has an upper
bound parameter. By default, the decision can range from prioritizing
none (0%) to all (100%) of a planning unit. However, a upper
bound can be specified to ensure that at most only a fraction
(e.g., 80%) of a planning unit can be preserved. This type of
decision may be useful when it is not practical to conserve the
entire area encompassed by any single planning unit.</p>
