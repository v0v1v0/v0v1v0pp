<h2>Compute the instability index of a protein sequence</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function calculates the instability index proposed by Guruprasad (1990). This index predicts the stability of a protein based on its amino acid composition, a protein whose instability index is smaller than 40 is predicted as stable, a value above 40 predicts that the protein may be unstable.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">instaIndex(seq)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>seq</code></td>
<td>
<p>An amino-acids sequence</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The computed instability index for a given amino-acids sequence
</p>
