<h2>Fluorescence emission spectra for chlorophylls.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Optical absorption spectra of chlorophyll <code class="reqn">a</code> in methanol and chlorophylls <code class="reqn">a</code>
and <code class="reqn">b</code> in diethyl ether containing the wavelengths at 1 nm interval.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>filter_mspct</code> with three member <code>filter_spct</code> objects
each with variable number of rows and 2 numeric variables, <code>w.length</code>
and <code>A</code>
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The variables of the member spectra are as follows:
</p>
 <ul>
<li>
<p> w.length (nm) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A (spectral absorbance) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data from PhotochemCAD 2.1a has been munged on 2 June 2017 by Scott
Prahl (<a href="https://omlc.org/">https://omlc.org/</a>) to make the information available to
non-Windows users. Although he has tried to be as careful as possible, he
may have introduced some error; the cautious user is advised to compare
these results with the original sources at
<a href="https://www.photochemcad.com/">https://www.photochemcad.com/</a> (Du et al., 1998; Dixon et al., 2005).
</p>
<p>Fluorescence emission was measured using a Spex FluoroMax. The excitation
and emission monochromators were set at 1 mm, giving a spectral bandwidth
of 4.25 nm.  The data interval was 0.5 nm and the integration time was 2.0
sec. Samples were prepared in 1cm path length quartz cells with absorbance
less than 0.1 at the excitation and all emission wavelengths to uniformly
illuminate across the sample, and to avoid the inner-filter effect. The
dark counts were subtracted and the spectra were corrected for
wavelength-dependent instrument sensitivity.
