<h2>Filter dyad-year data to include just politically relevant dyads</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>filter_prd()</code> filters a dyad-year data frame to just those that
are "politically relevant." This is useful for discarding unnecessary (and unwanted)
observations that just consume space in memory.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">filter_prd(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a dyad-year data frame (either "directed" or "non-directed")</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>"Political relevance" can be calculated a few ways. Right now, the function
considers only "direct" contiguity and Correlates of War major power status. You can employ
maximalist definitions of "direct contiguity" to focus on just the land-contiguous. This function
is inclusive of any type of contiguity relationship.
</p>
<p>As of version 0.5, <code>filter_prd()</code> is a shortcut for <code>add_contiguity()</code>
and/or <code>add_cow_majors()</code> if the function is executed in the absence of the data needed to create
politically relevant dyads. See the example below for what this means.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>filter_prd()</code> takes a dyad-year data frame, assuming it has columns for
major power status and contiguity type, calculates whether the dyad is "politically
relevant", and subsets the data frame to just those observations.
