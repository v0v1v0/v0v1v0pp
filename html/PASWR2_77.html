<h2>Swim Times</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Swimmers' improvements in seconds for two diets are stored in the data frame <code>SWIMTIMES</code>. The values in <code>seconds</code> represent the time improvement in seconds for swimmers.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SWIMTIMES
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 28 observations on the following 2 variables: 
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>seconds</code> (time improvement in seconds)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>diet</code> (a factor with levels <code>lowfat</code> and <code>highfat</code>)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Times for the thirty-two swimmers for the 200 yard individual medley were taken right after the swimmers' conference meet. The swimmers were randomly assigned to follow one of the diets.  One group followed a low fat diet the entire year but lost two swimmers along the way. The other group followed a high fat diet the entire year and also lost two swimmers.
