<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An online quiz for testing one's general knowledge was conducted by
the German weekly news magazine SPIEGEL in 2009. Overall, about 700,000
participants answered the quiz and a set of sociodemographic questions.
The general knowledge quiz consisted of a total of 45 items from five
different topics: politics, history, economy, culture and natural sciences.
For each topic, four different sets of nine items were available, that
were randomly assigned to the participants. A thorough analysis and
discussion of the original data set is provided in Trepte and Verbeet (2010).

<p>Here, we provide the subsample of university students enrolled in the
