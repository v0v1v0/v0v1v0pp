<h2>Show Duplicate Observations in Your Dyad-Year or State-Year Data Frame</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>show_duplicates()</code> shows which data are duplicated
in data generated in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>. It's a useful diagnostic tool
for users doing some do-it-yourself functions with <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">show_duplicates(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a dyad-year data frame or a state-year data frame created in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function leans on attributes of the data that are
provided by the <code>create_dyadyear()</code> or <code>create_stateyear()</code>
function. Make sure that function (or data created by that function)
appear at the top of the proverbial pipe.
</p>
<p>The data returned will also have a new column called <code>duplicated</code>.
Thus, an implicit assumption in this function is the user does not have
a column in the data with this name that is of interest to the user.
It will be overwritten.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>show_duplicates()</code> takes a dyad-year data frame or
state-year data frame generated in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> and
shows what observations are duplicated by unique combination of
dyad-year or state-year, contingent on what was supplied to it.
