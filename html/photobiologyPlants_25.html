<h2>Spectral optical data for 'Solidago altissima' leaves</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing for wavelengths at a 1 nm interval in the
range 350 to 1000 nm, tabulated values for total reflectance and total
transmittance, for the upper and lower epidermis of one leaf from the upper
part of a shoot and another one from the lower part of a shoot of tall
goldenrod (<em>Solidago altissima</em>).
</p>
<p>The variables in each spectrum are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> w.length (nm)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Rfr
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Tfr
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Solidago_altissima.mspct
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>object_mspct</code> collection object with four <code>object_spct</code>
member objects, each with 651 rows and 3 variables
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>We thank H. M. Noda for allowing us to include these data in our
package. We have included here only data for two leaves from one species
(<em>Solidago altissima</em>) and for wavelengths shorter than 1000 nm, from
the much larger original data set. The whole data set is publicly available
and the data easy to read into R. The data included here where measured
with a Li-Cor LI-1800 spectroradiometer equipped with a LI-1800-12 (Li-Cor)
integrating sphere, and consequently are for total reflectance and total
transmittance. Further details on methods are available through the JaLTER
web site. If you use these data in a publication, please cite the original
source as given under references and contact the original author. In
addition cite this package.
