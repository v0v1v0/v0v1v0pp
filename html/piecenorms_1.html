<h2>piecenorms: Calculate a Piecewise Normalised Score Using Class Intervals</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>piecenorms</code> has been built to calculate normalised data piecewise
using class intervals. This is useful in communication of highly skewed data.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For highly skewed data, the package <code>classInt</code> provides a series of options
for selecting class intervals. The <code>classInts</code> can be used as the breaks for
calculating the piecewise normalisation function <code>piecenorm</code>. The function
also allows the user to select their own breaks manually.
</p>
<p>For any call to <code>piecenorm</code>, the user provides a vector of observations,
a vector of breaks and a direction for the normalisation. The data is then
cut into classes and normalised within its class.
</p>
<p>Number of Bins:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn"> n = \text{length}(\text{brks}) - 1</code>
</p>

<p>Normalisation Class Intervals:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\left(\frac{i-1}{n}, \frac{i}{n}\right] \forall i \in \{1:n\}</code>
</p>

<p><strong>In cases where there is only one bin defined as <code>c(min(obs), max(obs))</code>,
the function <code>piecenorm</code> resolves to standard minmax normalisation</strong>.
</p>
<p>The <code>piecenorms</code> package also provides a <code>normalisr</code> R6 class that
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Classifies data into a likely distribution family
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Provides a recommendation of an appropriate normalisation technique
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Provides functionality to apply this normalisation technique to a
new data set
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is useful when the user would like to analyse how distributions have
changed over time.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>As with any non-linear transformation, piecewise normalization
preserves <em>ordinal invariance</em> within each class but does not preserve
<em>global relative magnitudes</em>. However, it does maintain <em>relative
magnitudes within each class</em>. On the other hand, more standard techniques
like <em>min-max</em> normalization preserves both <em>ordinal invariance</em>
and <em>global relative magnitudes</em>.
</p>
<p>Definitions of each are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>Ordinal Invariance:</strong> The property that the order of the data
points is preserved. If one normalized value is larger than another,
it reflects the same order as in the original data.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Non-Preservation of Relative Magnitudes (Global):</strong> This refers
to the loss of the proportionality of the original data values when
normalized. If one value is twice as large as another in the original data,
this relationship might not be preserved in the normalized data.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Ordinal Invariance:</strong> The property that the order of the data
points is preserved. If one normalized value is larger than another,
it reflects the same order as in the original data.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
