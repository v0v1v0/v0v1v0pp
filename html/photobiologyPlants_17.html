<h2>PHOT1 and PHOT2 absorbance spectra.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing the wavelengths at an arbitrary nm interval for plant
photoreceptors phototropin 1 and phototropin 2. Tabulated
values for the in vitro absorbance spectrum of PHOT1 LOV2 domain for
fluorescence yield of PHOT1 and PHOT2 from <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> measured in vitro.
PHOT1 fluorescence yield data were digitized from figure 1a curve
"LOV1 + LOV2 (WT) and PHOT2 fluorescence yield data were digitized from figure
7a curve "LOV1 + LOV2 (WT) in Christie et al. (2002). PHOT1 LOV2, dark
adapted, spectral absorbance data were digitized from figure 3, black
curve and PHOT1 LOV2, blue-light adapted spectral absorbance data were
digitized from figure 3, blue curve in Christie et al. (2015).

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>filter_mspct</code> with five member <code>filter_spct</code> objects each
with 300 rows and 2 numeric variables, <code>w.length</code> and <code>A</code>
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The variables of the member spectra are as follows:
</p>
 <ul>
<li>
<p> w.length (nm) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A (spectral absorbance) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note</h3>
