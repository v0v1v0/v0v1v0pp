<h2>Find the Kaiser, Meyer, Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Henry Kaiser (1970) introduced an Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA) of factor analytic data matrices. Kaiser and Rice (1974) then modified it. This is just a function of the squared elements of the ‘image’ matrix compared to the squares of the original correlations.  The overall MSA as well as estimates for each item are found. The index is known as the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) index.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">KMO(r)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>r</code></td>
<td>
<p>A correlation matrix or a data matrix (correlations will be found)</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Let  <code class="reqn">S^2 = diag(R^{-1})^{-1} </code> and <code class="reqn">Q = SR^{-1}S</code>.  Then Q is said to  be the anti-image intercorrelation matrix.  Let <code class="reqn">sumr2 = \sum{R^2}</code> and <code class="reqn">sumq2 = \sum{Q^2}</code> for all off diagonal elements of R and Q, then  <code class="reqn">SMA=sumr2/(sumr2 + sumq2)</code>.  Although originally MSA was 1 - sumq2/sumr2  (Kaiser, 1970), this was modified in Kaiser and Rice, (1974) to be   <code class="reqn">SMA=sumr2/(sumr2 + sumq2)</code>.  This is the formula used by Dziuban and Shirkey (1974) and by SPSS.
</p>
<p>In his delightfully flamboyant style, Kaiser (1975)
suggested that KMO &gt; .9 were marvelous, in the .80s, mertitourious, in the .70s, middling, in the .60s, medicore, in the 50s, miserable, and  less than .5, unacceptable.
</p>
<p>An alternative measure of whether the matrix is factorable is the Bartlett test  <code>cortest.bartlett</code> which tests the degree that the matrix deviates from an identity matrix.
