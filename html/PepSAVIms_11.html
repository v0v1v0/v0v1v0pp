<h2>Rank compounds via the Elastic Net path</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns identifying information for the compounds in the order in which the
corresponding regression coefficient for a given compound first becomes
nonzero as part of the Elastic Net path
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rankEN(msObj, bioact, region_ms = NULL, region_bio = NULL, lambda,
  pos_only = TRUE, ncomp = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>msObj</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>msDat</code> containing mass spectrometry
abundances data and identifying information.  Note that this includes
objects created by the functions <code>binMS</code>, <code>filterMS</code>, and
<code>msDat</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bioact</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either a numeric vector or matrix, or a data frame providing
bioactivity data.  If a numeric vector, then it is assumed that each
entry corresponds to a particular fraction.  If the data is
2-dimensional, then it is assumed that each column corresponds to a
particular fraction, and that each row corresponds to a particular
bioactivity replicate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>region_ms</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either <code>NULL</code>, or a vector either of mode character or
mode numeric providing information specifying which fractions from the
mass spectrometry abundances data are to be included in the data
analysis.  If <code>NULL</code>, then it is assumed that the entirety of the
mass spectrometry abundances data encapsulated in the argument to
<code>msObj</code> is to be included in the analysis.  If numeric then the
entries should provide the indices for the region of interest in the mass
spectrometry data (i.e. the indices of the columns corresponding to the
appropriate fractions in the data).  If character then the entries should
uniquely specify the region of interest through partial string matching
(i.e. the names of the columns corresponding to the appropriate fractions
in the data).  The methods <code>dim</code>, <code>dimnames</code>, and
<code>colnamesMS</code> can be used as interfaces to the mass spectrometry data
encapsulated in <code>msObj</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>region_bio</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either <code>NULL</code>, or a vector either of mode character or
mode numeric providing information specifying which fractions from the
bioactivity data are to be included in the data analysis.  If
<code>NULL</code>, then it is assumed that the entirety of bioactivity data
provided as the argument to <code>bioact</code> is to be included in the
analysis.  If numeric then the entries should provide the indices for the
region of interest in the bioactivity data (i.e. the indices of the
columns corresponding to the appropriate fractions in the data).  If
character then the entries should uniquely specify the region of interest
through partial string matching (i.e. the names of the columns
corresponding to the appropriate fractions in the data).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lambda</code></td>
<td>
<p>A single nonnegative numeric value providing the quadratic
penalty mixture parameter argument for the elastic net model.  The
elastic net fits the least squares model with penalty function
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\gamma|\beta|_1 + \lambda|\beta|^2</code>
</p>
<p> where <code class="reqn">\beta</code> is the vector
of regression coefficients and <code class="reqn">\gamma, \lambda \ge 0</code>.
<code>rankEN</code> constructs a list of candidate compounds by tracking the
entrance of compounds into the elastic net model as <code class="reqn">\gamma</code> is
decreased from <code class="reqn">\infty</code> to <code class="reqn">0</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pos_only</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>; specifies whether the
list of candidate compounds that the algorithm produces should include
only those compounds that are positively correlated with bioactivity
levels, or conversely should include all compounds.  The correlation is
calculated using only observations from the region of interest, and when
bioactivity replicates are present, the within-fraction replicates are
averaged prior to calculation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ncomp</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either <code>NULL</code>, or a numeric value no less than 1 specifying
the maximum number of candidate compounds that the function should
report.  When <code>NULL</code>, this is taken to mean that all compounds that
enter the model should be reported, possibly after removing compounds
nonpositively correlated with bioactivity levels, as specified by
<code>pos_only</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>rankEN</code> prepares the data by extracting the region of interest
from the mass spectrometry abundance data and from the bioactivity data.
If bioactivity replicates are present, then the within-fraction
replicates are averaged.  Once the data has been converted into the
appropriate form, then an elastic net model is fitted by invoking the
<code>enet</code> function from the <code>elasticnet</code> package, and an ordered
list of candidate compounds is constructed such that compounds are ranked
by the order in which they first enter the model.  The list may be
filtered and / or pruned before being returned to the user, as determined
by the arguments to <code>pos_only</code> and <code>ncomp</code>.
</p>
