<h2>Polya Sampling from an Urn with Possibly Unequal Weights</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Consider an urn containing
a finite set of values along with their respective positive weights.
An item is selected at random from the urn with probability
proportional to its weight.  Then it is returned to the urn and its
weight is increased by one.  The process is repeated on the
adjusted urn.  We continue until the total weight in the urn has
been increased by <code class="reqn">k</code>.
The original composition of the urn along with the k selected
values, in order, are returned.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">wtpolyap(ysamp, wts, k)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ysamp</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of real numbers which make up the urn.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>wts</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of positive weights which defines the initial
probability of selection.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive integer which specifies the number of Polya
samples taken from the urn where after each draw the weight of the selected
item is increased by one.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The returned value is a vector of length equal to the length of
the sample plus <code class="reqn">k</code>.</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">wtpolyap(c(0,1,2),c(0.5,1,1.5),22)
</code></pre>
