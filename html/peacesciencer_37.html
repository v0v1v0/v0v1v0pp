<h2>Correlates of War State-Year International Governmental Organizations (IGOs) Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a state-year version of the Correlates of War IGOs data. I use it internally for merging IGOs data into state-year data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cow_igo_sy
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 1557 observations on the following 5 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>ccode</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the Correlates of War state system code for the state</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>year</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the year</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sum_igo_full</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the sum of IGOs for which the state is a full member in a given year</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sum_igo_associate</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the sum of IGOs for which the state is just an associate member in a given year</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sum_igo_observer</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the sum of IGOs for which the state is just an observer in a given year</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sum_igo_anytype</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the sum of IGOs for which the state is a member of any kind in a given year.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>data-raw</code> directory on the project's Github contains additional information about how these data were generated from the otherwise
enormous dyad-year IGOs data provided by the Correlates of War project. Given the size of that data, and the size limitations of R packages for CRAN,
the data I provide here can only be simpler summaries. If you want specifics, you'll need to consult the underlying raw data provided on the Correlates
of War project.
