<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Manipulating pedigrees to prepare them for requirements of
subsequent analyses
Prepares a pedigree to conform with requirements of many softwares
used in quantitative genetic analysis, as well as for many of the
functions in pedtricks.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fix_ped(ped, dat = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ped</code></td>
<td>
<p>An ordered pedigree with 3 columns: id, dam, sire</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dat</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional data frame, the same length as the pedigree</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a pedigree in which all individuals that exist in the dam
and sire columns are represented by their own record lines, occurring
before the records of their first offspring.  If data are supplied,
then fix_ped will return a dataframe, the first three columns are
the 'fixed' pedigree, and the following columns of which contain
appropriately reordered data.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">##  a valid pedigree, i.e., no loops, no bisexuality, etc.,
## but where not all parents have a record line, and where
## parents do not necessarily occur before their offspring:
pedigree &lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(c(
  10, 1, 2,
  11, 1, 2,
  12, 1, 3,

  15, 6, 7,
  4, NA, NA,
  5, NA, NA,

  7, NA, NA
), 10, 3, byrow = TRUE))
