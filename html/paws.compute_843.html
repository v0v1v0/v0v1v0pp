<h2>This operation lists all of the services that are associated with a
Cloud Map namespace</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This operation lists all of the services that are associated with a Cloud Map namespace. This list might include services in different clusters. In contrast, <code>list_services</code> can only list services in one cluster at a time. If you need to filter the list of services in a single cluster by various parameters, use <code>list_services</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html">Service Connect</a> in the <em>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</em>.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_list_services_by_namespace/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_list_services_by_namespace/</a> for full documentation.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ecs_list_services_by_namespace(namespace, nextToken = NULL, maxResults = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>namespace</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The namespace name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Cloud Map
namespace to list the services in.
</p>
<p>Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services
in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the
clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy
container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only
the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service
Connect. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html">Service Connect</a>
in the <em>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</em>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nextToken</code></td>
<td>
<p>The <code>nextToken</code> value that's returned from a
<code>list_services_by_namespace</code> request.
It indicates that more results are available to fulfill the request and
further calls are needed. If <code>maxResults</code> is returned, it is possible
the number of results is less than <code>maxResults</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxResults</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum number of service results that
<code>list_services_by_namespace</code> returns
in paginated output. When this parameter is used,
<code>list_services_by_namespace</code> only
returns <code>maxResults</code> results in a single page along with a <code>nextToken</code>
response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be
seen by sending another
<code>list_services_by_namespace</code> request
with the returned <code>nextToken</code> value. This value can be between 1 and
100. If this parameter isn't used, then
<code>list_services_by_namespace</code> returns
up to 10 results and a <code>nextToken</code> value if applicable.</p>
