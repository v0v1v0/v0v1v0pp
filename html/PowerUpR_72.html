<h2>Partially Nested Designs Probing Multilevel Mediation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Two/One partially nested design occurs when subjects are recruited into groups for the treatment condition, but the remaining participants (or waiting list) are left for the control group (without any intervention clusters). If the interest is to design a sufficiently powered study to detect mediation effect in Two/One design, use <code>power.med_pn21()</code>.
</p>
<p>Three/One partially nested design occurs when subjects are recruited into groups, and a number of groups are guided by the same leader for the treatment condition, but the remaining participants (or waiting list) are left for the control group (without any intervention clusters). If the interest is to design a sufficiently powered study to detect mediation effect in Three/One design, use <code>power.med_pn31()</code>.
</p>
<p>Three/Two partially nested design occurs when subjects are recruited into groups, and a number of groups are guided by the same leader for the treatment condition, however, separate from Two/One and Three/One designs, the remaining participants are nested within providers in the control group (without any intervention clusters, but with nested structure). If the interest is to design a sufficiently powered study to detect mediation effect in Three/Two design, use <code>power.med_pn31()</code>.
