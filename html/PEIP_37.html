Inverse Theory Functions for PEIP book
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Auxilliary functions and routines for running the
examples and excersizes described in the book
on inverse theory.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These functions are used in conjunction with the example described in
the PEIP book.
</p>
<p>There is one C-code routine, interp2grid.
This is introduced to replicate the MATLAB code interp2.
It does not work exactly as the matlab code prescribes.
</p>
<p>In the PEIP library one LAPACK routine
is called: dggsvd.
In R, LAPACK routines are stored in slightly
different locations on Linux, Windows and Mac computers.
Be aware. This will come up in examples from Chapter 4.
</p>
<p>Almost all examples work as scripts 
run with virtually no user input, e.g.
