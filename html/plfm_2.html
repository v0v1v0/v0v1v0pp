<h2>Situational determinants of anger-related behavior</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The raw data consist of the binary judgments of 101 first-year psychology students who indicated whether or not they would display 
each of 8 anger-related behaviors when being angry at someone in each of 6 situations. 
The 8 behaviors consist of 4 pairs of reactions that reflect a particular strategy to deal with situations in which 
one is angry at someone, namely, (1) fighting (fly off the handle, quarrel), 
(2) fleeing (leave, avoid), (3) emotional sharing (pour out one's heart, tell one's story), 
and (4) making up (make up, clear up the matter). 
The six situations are constructed from two factors  with three levels: 
(1) the extent to which one likes the  instigator of anger (like, dislike, unfamiliar), 
and (2) the status of the instigator of anger (higher, lower, equal). 
Each situation is presented as one level of a factor, 
without specifying a level for the other factor.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(anger)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The data consist of a list of 5 objects:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> freq1: A 6 X 8 matrix of frequencies. The frequency in cell <em>(j,k)</em> indicates how many of 101 respondents 
would display reaction  <em>k</em> in situation <em>j</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> freqtot: A 6 X 8 matrix of frequencies. The frequency in cell <em>(j,k)</em> indicates the total number of respondents 
who judged the situation-response pair <em>(j,k)</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> rowlabels: A vector of labels for the situations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> columnlabels: A vector of labels for the anger-related reactions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> data: A 101 X 6 X 8 array of binary (0/1) values. the value in cell <em>(i,j,k)</em> equals 1 if
person <em>i</em> would display behavior <em>k</em> in situation <em>j</em>, and 0 otherwise.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
