<h2>
Apply Sweave to a collection of files.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows a master Sweave input file to specify other files in the
project.  All modified files will be run through <code>Sweave</code>.  Following
the run, several post-processing steps may be performed.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SweaveAll(SweaveFiles, make = 1, PostSweaveHook = NULL,
          force = TRUE, verbose = FALSE,
          weave = utils::Sweave, ...)
knitAll(RnwFiles, make = 1, PostKnitHook = NULL,
          force = TRUE, verbose = FALSE,
          weave = knitr::knit, ...)
renderAll(RmdFiles = NULL, make = 1, PostKnitHook = NULL,
          force = TRUE, verbose = FALSE,
          weave = rmarkdown::render, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SweaveFiles, RnwFiles, RmdFiles</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector naming the files to
run through <code>weave</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>make</code></td>
<td>

<p>integer indicating which files to run <code>weave</code> on.  See below.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>PostSweaveHook, PostKnitHook</code></td>
<td>

<p>default hook to be called after each <code>weave</code> call.  See below.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>force</code></td>
<td>

<p>If <code>TRUE</code>, all files in <code>SweaveFiles</code> will be run,
otherwise only those which are newer than the corresponding ‘<span class="file">.tex</span>’ file.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>

<p>Mainly for debugging:  print progress messages.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weave</code></td>
<td>

<p>The function to be used for converting from source to ‘<span class="file">.tex</span>’.
It will be called as <code>weave(filename, ...)</code> for each file
in <code>SweaveFiles</code> and other files identified as needing weaving.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>Extra parameters to pass to <code>weave</code>.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function runs <code>weave</code> repeatedly. It starts by
checking for a global variable <code>.SweaveFiles</code>, and
augments the <code>SweaveFiles</code> argument with any unprocessed
files in that list.  It then runs <code>weave</code>
on each file listed in <code>SweaveFiles</code>.
</p>
<p>Before each run, it removes the global variables
<code>.PostSweaveHook</code>, <code>.SweaveFiles</code>, and <code>.TexRoot</code>.  The
individual Sweave files may set these variables to control post-
processing as described below.
</p>
<p>Following each run, <code>SweaveAll</code> checks whether the code
chunks created a variable <code>.PostSweaveHook</code> in the global
environment.  If present, it should be a function (or the name of a
function; <code>match.fun</code> is used to do the lookup) taking a
single argument.  If not present, the <code>PostSweaveHook</code>
(or <code>PostKnitHook</code>) argument
will be used as a default.  <code>SweaveAll</code> will pass the name of the
‘<span class="file">.tex</span>’ output file to this function, which can do any required
postprocessing.  For example, we have used it to remove local
pathnames from output strings.
</p>
<p><code>SweaveAll</code> then checks again for <code>.SweaveFiles</code>, which if present
should be a character vector of filenames.  These are collected, and
after the <code>Sweave</code> runs specified by <code>SweaveFiles</code>, the
<code>make</code> parameter controls which other files are run.  The default
value of <code>1</code> works as follows:  any new files added via
<code>.SweaveFiles</code> that were not already processed are checked. If
they are newer than the corresponding ‘<span class="file">.tex</span>’ file, or the
‘<span class="file">.tex</span>’ file does not exist, they are processed.  They may also
return new filenames in the global <code>.SweaveFiles</code> variable and
those will be processed as well.
</p>
<p>Setting <code>make = 2</code> forces all mentioned files to be processed.
With <code>make = 0</code>, only the original vector of files passed to
<code>SweaveAll</code> will be processed.
</p>
<p><code>SweaveAll</code> also checks for a global variable named <code>.TexRoot</code>.
If present, it will be placed in the first position in the result vector.
(If it was already in the vector, later copies will be removed.)
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The names of all files produced.  The first element of
<code>Sweavefiles</code> will produce the first element of the result if
<code>.TexRoot</code> was not specified; other elements will depend on which
files were processed.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# Run Sweave on a main file, and obtain other files from there.
SweaveAll("main.Rnw")

# Run knitr on the same file.
SweaveAll("main.Rnw", weave = knitr::knit)

## End(Not run)</code></pre>
