<h2>Whittle Duplicate Conflict-Years by Highest Fatality</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>whittle_conflicts_fatality()</code> is in a class of
do-it-yourself functions for coercing (i.e. "whittling") conflict-year
data with cross-sectional units to unique conflict-year data by
cross-sectional unit. The inspiration here is clearly the problem
of whittling dyadic dispute-year data into true dyad-year data (like in
the Gibler-Miller-Little conflict data). This particular
function will keep the observations with the highest observed fatality.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">whittle_conflicts_fatality(data)

wc_fatality(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with a declared conflict attribute type.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, only to make the shortcut work</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Dyads are capable of having multiple disputes in a given year,
which can create a problem for merging into a complete dyad-year
data frame. Consider the case of France and Italy in 1860, which
had three separate dispute onsets that year (MID#0112, MID#0113, MID#0306),
as illustrative of the problem. The default process in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>
employs several rules to whittle down these duplicate dyad-years for
merging into a dyad-year data frame. These are available in
<code>add_cow_mids()</code> and <code>add_gml_mids()</code>.
</p>
<p>As of writing, the Correlates of War and Gibler-Miller-Little conflict
data record some -9s for fatalities. In those cases, dispute-level
fatality is momentarily recoded to be .5 (i.e. fatal, but without too
many fatalities). This is a missing data problem that Gibler and Miller
correct in a forthcoming publication in <em>Journal of Conflict Resolution</em>.
Until then, this function makes that kind of determination about
disputes with missing fatalities.
</p>
<p><code>wc_fatality()</code> is a simple, less wordy, shortcut for the same function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>whittle_conflicts_fatality()</code> takes a dyad-year data frame
or leader-dyad-year data frame with a declared conflict attribute type
and, grouping by the dyad and year, returns just those observations
that have the highest observed dispute-level fatality. This will not
eliminate all duplicates, far from it, but it's a sensible second cut
(after whittling onsets in <code>whittle_conflicts_onsets()</code> the extent
to which dispute-level fatality is a good heuristic for dispute-level
severity/importance.
