<h2>DP_PSSM feature vector</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This feature results from the connection of two vectors. The vector is the first feature of a
vector with a length of 40, which calculates the average of positive and negative values for each column
separately and puts them together. in the second feature vector, correspond to each column the difference
between the numbers in the rows that have distance of k is calculated, and then the square average for the
differences that are positive is calculated, and the same action  for the differences that are negative is
performed. since k varies between 1 and <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>, and because the value of <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> in this function is equal to 2,
the length of the second feature vector will be 80, which by merging with the first feature vector, the total
feature vector of length 120 will be obtained.
