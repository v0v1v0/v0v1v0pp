<h2>A package for estimating and mapping disaggregated indicators</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package <span class="pkg">emdi</span> supports estimating and mapping regional
disaggregated indicators. For estimating these indicators, direct estimation,
the unit-level Empirical Best Prediction approach by
<cite>Molina and Rao (2010)</cite>, the extension for data under informative
selection by <cite>Guadarrama et al. (2018)</cite>, the area-level model by
<cite>Fay and Herriot (1979)</cite> and various extensions of it (adjusted variance
estimation methods, log and arcsin transformation, spatial, robust and
measurement error models) are provided. Depending on the particular method,
analytical, bootstrap and jackknife MSE estimation approaches are
implemented. The assessment of the used model is supported by a summary and
diagnostic plots. For a suitable presentation of estimates, map plots can be
easily created. Furthermore, results can easily be exported to Excel.
Additionally, for the area-level models a stepwise variable selection
function, benchmarking options and spatial correlation tests are provided.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The three estimation functions are called <code>direct</code>,
<code>ebp</code> and <code>fh</code>. For all functions, several methods
are available as <code>estimators.emdi</code> and
<code>emdi_summaries</code>. For a full list, please see
<code>emdiObject</code>. Furthermore, functions <code>map_plot</code> and
<code>write.excel</code> help to visualize and export results. An overview
of all currently provided functions can be requested by
<code>library(help=emdi)</code>.
