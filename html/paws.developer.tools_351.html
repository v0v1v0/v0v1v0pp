<h2>Deletes a previously created webhook by name</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Deletes a previously created webhook by name. Deleting the webhook stops CodePipeline from starting a pipeline every time an external event occurs. The API returns successfully when trying to delete a webhook that is already deleted. If a deleted webhook is re-created by calling PutWebhook with the same name, it will have a different URL.
