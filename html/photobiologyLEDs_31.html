<h2>Spectra acquired with an Ocean Optics Maya2000 Pro spectrometer</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The collection of spectra <code>leds.mspct</code> contains spectra for some
COB arrays of light emitting diodes (LEDs) from multiple sources. Most of
them were measured with the same spectrometer. Data are normalized to one at
the wavelength of maximum emission. The character vector <code>oo_maya_leds</code>
contains the names of the spectra to facilitate their extraction from the
collection. The vector <code>oo_maya_leds</code> contains the names of
the spectra acquired with an Ocean Optics Maya2000
Pro spectrometer to facilitate their extraction from the collection..

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">oo_maya_leds
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A vector of character strings.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Instrument used is an Ocean Optics Maya2000 Pro single-monochromator array
spectroradiometer with a Bentham cosine corrected input optics. A complex
set of corrections and calibration procedure used. Raw spectral data
were acquired and/or processed with R package 'ooacquire'.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Ocean Optics is now named Ocean Insight.
