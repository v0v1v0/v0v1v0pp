<h2>
Merging several <code>ComparisonResults</code> class objects
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function can be used to join several objects of class <code>ComparisonResults</code>  
into a single object. The merge is carried out assuming that there is
something in common between the objects (e.g. all use the same
workflows on different tasks), and that the user specifies which
property should be used for the merging process.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mergeEstimationRes(..., by = "tasks")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>The <code>ComparisonResults</code> class object names separated by commas
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>by</code></td>
<td>

<p>The dimension of the <code>ComparisonResults</code> class objects that should be used
for the merge. All objects should have the same values on the
remaining dimensions of an estimation experiment. For instance, if you
merge by "tasks" (the default) it means that the objects being merged
should include estimation results on the same set of workflows on the
same set of metrics, using the same estimation method and
settings. The only thing that changes between the objects in this
example is the set of tasks. Possible values of this argument are:
"tasks", "workflows" and "metrics".

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The objects of class <code>ComparisonResults</code> (type "class?ComparisonResults"
for details) contain several information on the results of an
estimation expriment for several workflows on several predictive
tasks. Sometimes, when you are trying too many workflows on too many
tasks, it is convinient to run these variants on different calls to
the function <code>performanceEstimation</code>. After all calls are
completed we frequently want to have all results on a single
object. This is the objective of the current function: allow you to
merge these different <code>ComparisonResults</code> objects
into a single one. For being mergeable the objects need to have things
in common otherwise it makes no sense to merge them. For instance, we
could split our very large experiment by calling
<code>performanceEstimation</code> with different tasks, although the
rest (the workflows and the estimation task) stays the same. See the
Examples section for some illustrations.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The result of this function is a <code>ComparisonResults</code> object.
