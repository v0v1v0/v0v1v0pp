<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">resourceexplorer_list_views(MaxResults = NULL, NextToken = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>MaxResults</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum number of results that you want included on each page of the
response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value
appropriate to the operation. If additional items exist beyond those
included in the current response, the <code>NextToken</code> response element is
present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the
<code>NextToken</code> request parameter in the next call to the operation to get
the next part of the results.
</p>
<p>An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when
there are more results available. You should check <code>NextToken</code> after
every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>NextToken</code></td>
<td>
<p>The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a
<code>NextToken</code> response in a previous request. A <code>NextToken</code> response
indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value
of the previous call's <code>NextToken</code> response to indicate where the output
should continue from. The pagination tokens expire after 24 hours.</p>
