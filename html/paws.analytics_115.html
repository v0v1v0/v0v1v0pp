<h2>Task runners call PollForTask to receive a task to perform from AWS Data
Pipeline</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Task runners call <code>poll_for_task</code> to receive a task to perform from AWS Data Pipeline. The task runner specifies which tasks it can perform by setting a value for the <code>workerGroup</code> parameter. The task returned can come from any of the pipelines that match the <code>workerGroup</code> value passed in by the task runner and that was launched using the IAM user credentials specified by the task runner.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/datapipeline_poll_for_task/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/datapipeline_poll_for_task/</a> for full documentation.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">datapipeline_poll_for_task(
  workerGroup,
  hostname = NULL,
  instanceIdentity = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>workerGroup</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The type of task the task runner is configured to accept and process.
The worker group is set as a field on objects in the pipeline when they
are created. You can only specify a single value for <code>workerGroup</code> in
the call to <code>poll_for_task</code>. There are no
wildcard values permitted in <code>workerGroup</code>; the string must be an exact,
case-sensitive, match.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hostname</code></td>
<td>
<p>The public DNS name of the calling task runner.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>instanceIdentity</code></td>
<td>
<p>Identity information for the EC2 instance that is hosting the task
runner. You can get this value from the instance using
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id⁠</code>. For more
information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html">Instance Metadata</a>
in the <em>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.</em> Passing in this value
proves that your task runner is running on an EC2 instance, and ensures
the proper AWS Data Pipeline service charges are applied to your
pipeline.</p>
