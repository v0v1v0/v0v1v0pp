<h2>pstest: An R Package for assessing the goodness-of-fit of parametric propensity score models.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The propensity score is one of the most widely used tools in studying the causal effect
of a treatment, intervention, or policy. Given that the propensity score is usually unknown,
it has to be estimated, implying that the reliability of many treatment effect estimators depends
on the correct specification of the (parametric) propensity score. This package provides
data-driven nonparametric diagnostic tools for detecting propensity score misspecification.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This R package implements the class of specification test for the propensity score
proposed in Sant'Anna and Song (2016), ‘Specification Tests for the Propensity Score’,
available at Pedro H.C. Sant'Anna webpage, <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/pedrohcsantanna/">http://sites.google.com/site/pedrohcsantanna/</a>.
</p>
<p>In short, this package implements Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cramer-von Mises type tests
for parametric propensity score models with either logistic ('logit'), or
normal ('probit') link function. Critical values are computed with the assistance of a
multiplier bootstrap.
</p>
<p>The tests are based on the integrated conditional moment approach, where the weight function
used is based on an orthogonal projection onto the tangent space of nuisance parameters.
As a result, the tests (a) enjoy improved power properties, (b) do not suffer from the
'curse of dimensionality' when the vector of covariates is of high-dimensionality,
(c) are fully data-driven, (e) do not require tuning parameters such as bandwidths, and
(e) are able to detect a broad class of local alternatives converging to the null at the
parametric rate. These appealing features highlight that the tests can be of great use
in practice.
</p>
<p>It is worth stressing that this package implements in a unified manner a large class of
specification tests, depending on the chosen weight function <code class="reqn">w(q,u)</code>:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>‘ind’ - the indicator weight function <code class="reqn">w(q,u)=1(q \le u)</code>. This is the default.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘exp’ - the exponential weight function <code class="reqn">w(q,u)=exp(qu)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘logistic’ - the logistic weight function <code class="reqn">w(q,u)=1/[1+exp(1-qu)]</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘sin’ - the sine weight function <code class="reqn">w(q,u)=sin(qu)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘sincos’ - the sine and cosine weight function <code class="reqn">w(q,u)=sin(qu)+cos(qu)</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Different weight functions <code class="reqn">w(q,u)</code> have different power properties, and therefore,
being able to choose different <code class="reqn">w(q,u)</code> gives us flexibility to direct power in desired
directions.
