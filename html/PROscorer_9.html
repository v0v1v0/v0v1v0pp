<h2>Score the EORTC QLQ-PAN26 Quality of Life Questionnaire</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Scores the European Organization for Research and Treatment of
Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-PAN26 Pancreatic Cancer Module. (Experimental: This
function was written quickly... please hand score 1 or 2 patients and check
for accuracy)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">qlq_pan26(df, items = NULL, keepNvalid = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing responses to the 26 QLQ-PAN26 items, and
possibly other variables.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>items</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector with the QLQ-PAN26 item names, or a numeric
vector indicating the column numbers of the QLQ-PAN26 items in <code>df</code>.
If <code>items</code> is omitted, then <code>qlq_PAN26</code> will assume that
<code>df</code> contains <strong>ONLY</strong> the QLQ-PAN26 items and no other variables.
See Details for more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keepNvalid</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical, whether to return variables containing the
number of valid, non-missing items on each scale for each respondent should
be returned in the data frame with the scale scores.  The default is
<code>FALSE</code>.  Set to <code>TRUE</code> to return these variables, which will be
named <code>"scalename_N"</code> (e.g., <code>QL_N</code>).  Most users should omit
this argument entirely.  This argument might be removed from future
versions of the package, so please let me know if you think this argument
useful and would rather it remain a part of the function.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function returns a total of 17 different scores from the EORTC
QLQ-PAN26. Scores are calculated according to the official scoring algorithms
from the EORTC.  At the time this scoring function was written (April 2022),
the QLQ-PAN26 had completed Phase 3 testing; however, the official scoring
instructions from the EORTC warned that this scaling structure is still
preliminary and may change in the future.
</p>
<p>In addition to the name of your data frame containing the QLQ-PAN26 item
responses (<code>df</code>), you need to tell the function how to find the
variables that correspond to the QLQ-PAN26 items in <code>df</code>.  You can do this
in 1 of 2 ways:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> The first way is to manually provide the item names or locations
using the <code>items</code> argument.  For example, if your first 10
variables in <code>df</code> contain demographics, followed by the 26 QLQ-PAN26
items <strong>in order</strong> starting with the 11th variable, then you could
use <code>items = 11:36</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The second way only applies if your data frame (<code>df</code>) contains
<strong>ONLY</strong> the 26 variables corresponding to the 26 QLQ-PAN26 items,
in order, with no other non-QLQ-PAN26 variables.  In this case, you can
just use the <code>df</code> argument and omit <code>items</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with all 17 of the QLQ-PAN26 scores is returned.  Of the 17
scores, 15 are Symptom Scales and 2 are Functional Scales (see below).  Of
the 15 Symptom Scales, 10 are based on a single item each.  All scores are
scaled to range from 0-100, even scores based on single items.  Be aware that
these single-item scales still have only 4 possible values, even though they
are transformed to range from 0-100.  The scale names and numbers of items are
listed below.
</p>
<p><strong>Symptom Scales (higher is more symptoms, worse functioning)</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_PP</strong> - Pancreatic pain (from 4 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_BF</strong> - Bloating (from 1 item)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_DS</strong> - Digestive symptoms (from 2 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_TA</strong> - Taste (from 1 item)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_ID</strong> - Indigestion (from 1 item)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_FL</strong> - Flatulence (from 1 item)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_WL</strong> - Weight loss (from 1 item)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_WE</strong> - Weakness arms and legs (from 1 item)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_DM</strong> - Dry mouth (from 1 item)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_LI</strong> - Hepatic symptoms (from 2 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_BO</strong> - Altered bowel habit (from 2 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_BI</strong> - Body image (from 2 item)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_SE</strong> - Troubled with side-effects(from 1 item)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_FU</strong> - Future Worries (from 1 item)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_PL</strong> - Planning of activities (from 1 item)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Functional Scales (higher is better functioning)</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_SA</strong> - Satisfaction with health care (from 2 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_SX</strong> - Sexuality (from 2 items)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Optionally, the data frame can additionally have variables containing the
number of valid item responses on each scale for each respondent (if
<code>keepNvalid = TRUE</code>, but this option might be removed in future package
updates).
</p>


<h3>How Missing Data is Handled</h3>

<p>The <code>qlq_PAN26</code> function will calculate the scale scores as long as at
least half of the items on the given scale have valid, non-missing item
responses.  Scores calculated in the presence of missing
items are pro-rated so that their theoretical minimum and maximum values
are identical to those from scores calculated from complete data.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><strong>As of April 15, 2022, there is an error in the official PAN26 scoring
instructions from the EORTC.</strong>
The first page of the official PAN26 scoring instructions from the EORTC
indicates that the two items comprising the SA (Satisfaction with health
care) functional scale should be reverse scored.  In the instructions, these
two items are numbered as 53 and 54.  However, the second page of the
instructions indicates items 55 and 56 should be reversed (see bullet, "(1)
Raw score" in the "Principle for scoring" subsection).  Items 55 and 56
comprise the SX (Sexuality) functional scale.
<strong>The items that need to be reversed are the SX items (55 and 56), NOT
the SA items (not 53 and 54).</strong>  This function correctly reverses the SX items
instead of the SA items.
