  ProtectionGroupId,
  NextToken = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ProtectionGroupId</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The name of the protection group. You use this to identify the
protection group in lists and to manage the protection group, for
example to update, delete, or describe it.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>NextToken</code></td>
<td>
<p>When you request a list of objects from Shield Advanced, if the response
does not include all of the remaining available objects, Shield Advanced
includes a <code>NextToken</code> value in the response. You can retrieve the next
batch of objects by requesting the list again and providing the token
that was returned by the prior call in your request.
</p>
<p>You can indicate the maximum number of objects that you want Shield
Advanced to return for a single call with the <code>MaxResults</code> setting.
Shield Advanced will not return more than <code>MaxResults</code> objects, but may
return fewer, even if more objects are still available.
</p>
<p>Whenever more objects remain that Shield Advanced has not yet returned
to you, the response will include a <code>NextToken</code> value.
</p>
<p>On your first call to a list operation, leave this setting empty.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>MaxResults</code></td>
<td>
<p>The greatest number of objects that you want Shield Advanced to return
to the list request. Shield Advanced might return fewer objects than you
indicate in this setting, even if more objects are available. If there
are more objects remaining, Shield Advanced will always also return a
<code>NextToken</code> value in the response.
</p>
<p>The default setting is 20.</p>
