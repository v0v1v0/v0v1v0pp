<h2>Updates routing priority and age on the contact (QueuePriority and
QueueTimeAdjustmentInSeconds)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Updates routing priority and age on the contact (<strong>QueuePriority</strong> and <strong>QueueTimeAdjustmentInSeconds</strong>). These properties can be used to change a customer's position in the queue. For example, you can move a contact to the back of the queue by setting a lower routing priority relative to other contacts in queue; or you can move a contact to the front of the queue by increasing the routing age which will make the contact look artificially older and therefore higher up in the first-in-first-out routing order. Note that adjusting the routing age of a contact affects only its position in queue, and not its actual queue wait time as reported through metrics. These properties can also be updated by using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/change-routing-priority.html">the Set routing priority / age flow block</a>.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>InstanceId</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/find-instance-arn.html">find the instance ID</a>
in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ContactId</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The identifier of the contact in this instance of Amazon Connect.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>QueueTimeAdjustmentSeconds</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of seconds to add or subtract from the contact's routing age.
Contacts are routed to agents on a first-come, first-serve basis. This
means that changing their amount of time in queue compared to others
also changes their position in queue.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>QueuePriority</code></td>
<td>
<p>Priority of the contact in the queue. The default priority for new
contacts is 5. You can raise the priority of a contact compared to other
contacts in the queue by assigning them a higher priority, such as 1 or
2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>RoutingCriteria</code></td>
<td>
<p>Updates the routing criteria on the contact. These properties can be
used to change how a contact is routed within the queue.</p>
