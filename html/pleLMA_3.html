<h2>Dateframe of responses to items from depression, anxiety, and stress scales</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The dass data are responses from a random sample of 1,000 individuals
collected during the period 2017 â€“ 2019. The data were retrieved July
2020.  The items included here are on scales designed to measure
depression (14 items), anxiety (13 items), and stress (15 items).  The
42 items were presented online and in random order.  Respondents were
instructed to consider the last week when responding to the items using the
following categories:
(1) Did not apply to me at all;
(2) Applied to me to some degree, or some of the time;
(3) Applied to me to a considerable degree, or a good part of the time;
(4) Applied to me very much, or most of the time.
