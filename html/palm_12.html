<h2>palm: A package to fit point process models via the Palm
likelihood</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>First proposed by Tanaka, Ogata, and Stoyan (2008), maximisation of
the Palm likelihood can provide computationally efficient parameter
estimation for point process models in situations where the full
likelihood is intractable. This package contains functions to fit a
variety of point process models, but is chiefly concerned with
Neyman-Scott point processes (NSPPs).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The development of this package was motivated by the analysis of
capture-recapture surveys on which individuals cannot be
identified—the data from which can conceptually be seen as a NSPP
(Fewster, Stevenson, and Borchers, 2016). As such, some of the
functions in this package are specifically for the estimation of
cetacean density from two-camera aerial surveys; see Stevenson,
Borchers, and Fewster (2019).
</p>
<p>This package can also fit void processes, which, along with NSPPs,
have been fitted to patterns of colon cancer and stroma cell
locations (Jones-Todd et al., 2019).
</p>
<p>The main functions of this package are summarised below.
</p>


<h3>Model fitting</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> The fit.ns function fits NSPPs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The fit.twocamera function estimates animal density
from two-camera aerial surveys. This model is a NSPP and can
be fitted using fit.ns, but it is more straightforward
to use fit.twocamera.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The fit.void function fits void point processes.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Variance estimation</h3>

<p>Variance estimation is achieved by parametric bootstrap. The
boot.palm function carries out this procedure from an object
generated by one of the fitting functions, above. Confidence
intervals and standard errors can be calculated from an object
returned by boot.palm using confint.palm and
coef.palm, respectively.
</p>


<h3>Data simulation</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> The sim.ns function simulates data from NSPPs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The sim.twocamera function simulates detection data
from two-camera aerial surveys.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The sim.void function simulates data from void point
processes.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
