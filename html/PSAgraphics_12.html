<h2>Data on 996 initial Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCIs) performed in
1997 at the Lindner Center, Christ Hospital, Cincinnati.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from an observational study of 996 patients receiving a PCI at Ohio
Heart Health in 1997 and followed for at least 6 months by the staff of the
Lindner Center. This is a landmark dataset in the literature on propensity
score adjustment for treatment selection bias due to practice of evidence
based medicine; patients receiving abciximab tended to be more severely
diseased than those who did not receive a IIb/IIIa cascade blocker.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 996 observations on the following 10 variables, no NAs.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>lifepres</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mean life years preserved due to survival for at least 6 months following PCI; numeric value of either 11.4 or 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt>cardbill</dt>
<dd>
<p>Cardiac related costs incurred within 6
months of patient's initial PCI; numeric value in 1998 dollars; costs were
truncated by death for the 26 patients with lifepres == 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt>abcix</dt>
<dd>
<p>Numeric treatment selection indicator; 0 implies usual
PCI care alone; 1 implies usual PCI care deliberately augmented by either
planned or rescue treatment with abciximab.</p>

<dd>
<p>Coronary
stent deployment; numeric, with 1 meaning YES and 0 meaning NO.</p>

<dt>height</dt>
<dd>
<p>Height in centimeters; numeric integer from 108 to
196.</p>

</dd>
<dt>acutemi</dt>
<dd>
<p>Acute
myocardial infarction within the previous 7 days; numeric, with 1 meaning
YES and 0 meaning NO.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ejecfrac</dt>
<dd>
<p>Left ejection fraction;
numeric value from 0 percent to 90 percent.</p>

of vessels involved in the patient's initial PCI procedure; numeric integer
from 0 to 5.</p>
