<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All consecutive patients seen at the Eating Disorders Outpatient Clinic of the Psychiatric Service at Galdakao Hospital between October 1996 and October 1997 were eligible for the study. Patients were included if they were ambulatory; had received a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa based on criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV); and were between the ages of 14 and 65 years.
</p>
<p>Throughout the 2-year study period, each of the 193 patient received a psychopharmacologic and psychotherapeutic treatment program consisting of cognitive-behavioural treatment; nutritional orientation and counselling; psychoeducation; motivationaltherapy; social skills training; and therapy to modify distorted perception of body image. These interventions were adjusted to each patient's needs by a multidisciplinary team.
</p>
<p>At most, 3 measurements were obtained from each of the 193 patients: at baseline, at one year, and at two years from the start of the study. Clinical measurements and Helath-Related Quality of Life (HQRoL) data were recorded at each visit using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Scale helath questionnaires.
