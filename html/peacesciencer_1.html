<h2>Add Archigos political leader information to dyad-year and state-year data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_archigos()</code> allows you to add some information about leaders to dyad-year
or state-year data. The function leans on an abbreviated version of the data, which also comes in this package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_archigos(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a dyad-year data frame (either "directed" or "non-directed") or state-year data frame</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function leans on attributes of the data that are provided by the <code>create_dyadyear()</code> or
<code>create_stateyear()</code> function. Make sure that function (or data created by that function) appear at the top
of the proverbial pipe.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_archigos()</code> takes a dyad-year or state-year data frame and adds a few summary
variables based off the leader-level data. These include whether there was a leader transition in the
state-year (or first/second state in the dyad-year), whether there was an "irregular" leader transition,
the number of leaders in the state-year, the unique leader ID for Jan. 1 of the year, and the unique leader
ID for Dec. 31 of the year.
