<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Create a discrete variable from a continuous one as indicated by interval
mappings. The discrete  variable value depends on interval in which the
continuous variable value  lies. The mapping from intervals to discrete
values can be given in an  external table file referred to in the
transform command or as a list of data frames.
</p>
<p>Given a list of intervals and the discrete value each interval is linked to,
a discrete variable is defined with the value indicated by the interval
where it lies in. If a continuous variable <b>InVar</b> of data type
<b>InType</b> is to be converted to a variable <b>OutVar</b> of data type
<b>OutType</b>, the transformation command is in the format:
</p>
<p>xform_info = "[InVar-&gt;OutVar][InType-&gt;OutType]", table="TableFileName", <br>
default_value="defVal", map_missing_to="missingVal"
</p>
<p>where <b>TableFileName</b> is the name of the CSV file containing the
interval to discrete value map.  The data types of the variables can be any
of the ones defined in the PMML format including integer, double or string.
<b>defVal</b> is the default value of the transformed variable and if any of
the input values are missing, <b>missingVal</b> is the value of the
transformed variable.
</p>
<p>The arguments InType, OutType, default_value and map_missing_to are optional.
The CSV file containing the table should not have any row and column
identifiers, and the values given must be in the same order as in the map
command. If the data types of the variables are not given, the data types of
the input variables are attempted to be determined from the <b>boxData</b>
argument.  If that is not possible, the data types are assumed to be string.
</p>
<p>Intervals are either given by the left or right limits, in which case the
other limit is considered as infinite. It may also be given by both the left
and right limits separated by the character ":". An example of how intervals
should be defined in the external file are:
</p>
<pre>
rightVal1),outVal1
rightVal2],outVal2
[leftVal1:rightVal3),outVal3
(leftVal2:rightVal4],outVal4
(leftVal,outVal5
</pre>
<p>which, given an input value <b>inVal</b> and the output value to be
calculated <b>out</b>, means that:
</p>
<pre>
if(inVal &lt; rightVal1) out=outVal1
f(inVal &lt;= rightVal2) out=outVal2
if( (inVal &gt;= leftVal1) and (inVal &lt; rightVal3) ) out=outVal3
if( (inVal &gt; leftVal2) and (inVal &lt;= rightVal4) ) out=outVal4
if(inVal &gt; leftVal) out=outVal5
</pre>
<p>It is also possible to give the information about the transforms without an
external file, using a list of data frames.  Each data frame defines a
discretization operation for 1 input variable. The first row of the data
frame gives the original field name, the derived field name, the left
interval, the left value, the right interval and the right value. The second
row gives the data type of the values as listed in the first row. The second
row with the data types of the fields is not required. If not given, all
fields are assumed to be strings. In this input format, the 'default_value'
and 'map_missing_to' parameters should be vectors. The first element of each
vector will correspond to the derived field defined in the 1st element of
the 'xform_info' list etc. Although somewhat more complicated, this method is
designed to not require any external features. Further, once the initial list
is constructed, modifying it is a simple operation; making this a better
method to use if the parameters of the transformation are to be modified
frequently and/or automatically. This is made more clear in the example
below.

# This is a transformation that defines a derived field 'dis_pl'

# 'Petal.Length' has a value less than 0. The derived field has a
# value '1' if the input is greater than or equal to 0 and less
# than 1. Note that the values of the 1st column after row 2 have
# been deliberately given NA values in the middle. This is to
# show that that column is meant for a textual representation of
# the transformation as defined for the method involving external
# files; however in this methodtheir values are not used.

# Add the data frame to a list. The default values and the missing
