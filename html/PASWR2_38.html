<h2>Hubble Telescope</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope was put into orbit on April 25, 1990. Unfortunately, on June 25, 1990, a spherical aberration was discovered in Hubble's primary mirror. To correct this, astronauts had to work in space. To prepare for the mission, two teams of astronauts practiced  making repairs under simulated space conditions. Each team of astronauts went through 15 identical scenarios. The times to complete each scenario were recorded in days.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">HUBBLE
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 15 observations on the following 2 variables: 
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>team1</code> (days to complete scenario)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>team2</code> (days to complete scenario)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
