<h2>Water treatment example from BHH2, Ch 5, Question 19</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data are from the first 8 rows of the pollutant water treatment example
in the book by Box, Hunter and Hunter, 2nd edition, Chapter 5, Question 19.
</p>
<p>The 3 factors (C, T, and S) are in coded units where:
C: -1 is chemical brand A; +1 is chemical brand B
T: -1 is 72F for treatment temperature; +1 is 100F for the temperature
S: -1 is No stirring; +1 is with fast stirring
</p>
<p>The outcome variable is:
y: the pollutant amount in the discharge [lb/day].
</p>
<p>The aim is to find treatment conditions that MINIMIZE the amount of pollutant
discharged each day, where the limit is 10 lb/day.
</p>
