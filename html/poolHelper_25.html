<h2>Create VCF file from Pool-seq data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates and saves a file with the information from Pool-seq data coded in the
VCF format.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pool2vcf(reference, alternative, total, file, pos = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reference</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a list where each entry corresponds to a different locus.
Each list entry is a vector with the number of reads with the reference
allele. Each entry of the vector corresponds to a different SNP. This list
can have a single entry if the data is comprised of a single locus.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alternative</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a list where each entry corresponds to a different
locus. Each list entry is a vector with the number of reads with the
alternative allele. Each entry of the vector corresponds to a different
SNP. This list can have a single entry if the data is comprised of a single
locus.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>total</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a list where each entry corresponds to a different locus.
Each list entry is a vector with the total number of reads observed at each
SNP. Each entry of the vector corresponds to a different SNP. This list can
have a single entry if the data is comprised of a single locus.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a character string naming the file to write to.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pos</code></td>
<td>
<p>is an optional input (default is NULL). If the actual position of
the SNPs are known, they can be used as input here. When working with a
single locus, this should be a numeric vector with each entry corresponding
to the position of each SNP. If the data has multiple loci, this should be
a list where each entry is a numeric vector with the position of the SNPs
for a different locus.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It starts by converting the number of reads with the <code>reference</code> allele,
the <code>alternative</code> allele and the <code>total</code> depth of coverage to a
R,A:DP string. R is the number of reads of the reference allele, A is the
number of reads of the alternative allele and DP is the total depth of
coverage.
</p>
<p>Then, this information coded as R,A:DP is combined with other necessary
information such as the chromosome of each SNP, the position of the SNP and
the quality of the genotype among others. This creates a data frame where
each row corresponds to a different SNP.
</p>
<p>A <code>file</code> is then created and saved in the current working directory,
with the header lines that go above the table in a VCF file. Finally, the
data frame is appended to that file.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a file in the current working directory containing Pool-seq data in
the VCF format.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># simulate Pool-seq data for 100 individuals sampled at a single locus
