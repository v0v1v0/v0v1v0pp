<h2>Structural analysis example data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Example data used for the vignette about structural analysis. The data was obtained from
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420316913">Cappelletti 2021</a>
and corresponds to two separate experiments. Both experiments were limited proteolyis coupled to
mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) experiments conducted on purified proteins. The first protein is
phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (pgk) and it was treated with 25mM 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PG).
The second protein is phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase (ptsI) and it was treated
with 25mM fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP). From both experiments only peptides belonging to
either protein were used for this data set. The ptsI data set contains precursor level data
while the pgk data set contains peptide level data. The pgk data can be obtained from
supplementary table 3 from the tab named "pgk+3PG". The ptsI data is only included as raw data
and was analysed using the functions of this package.
