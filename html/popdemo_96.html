<h2>Calculate asymptotic growth</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate the true asymptotic growth of a population matrix projection model
from the model projection
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">truelambda(A, vector = "n", accuracy = 1e-07, iterations = 1e+05)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>A</code></td>
<td>
<p>a square, non-negative numeric matrix of any dimension</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vector</code></td>
<td>
<p>(optional) a numeric vector or one-column matrix describing 
the age/stage distribution used to calculate the projection.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>accuracy</code></td>
<td>
<p>the accuracy with which to determine convergence on 
asymptotic growth, expressed as a proportion (see details).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>iterations</code></td>
<td>
<p>the maximum number of iterations of the model before the 
code breaks.  For slowly-converging models and/or high specified convergence
accuracy, this may need to be increased.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>truelambda</code> works by simulating the given model and manually determining 
growth when convergence to the given <code>accuracy</code> is reached. Convergence 
on an asymptotic growth is deemed to have been reached when the growth of the 
model stays within the window determined by <code>accuracy</code> for 10*s 
iterations of the model, with s equal to the dimension of <code>A</code>. For example, 
projection of an 8 by 8 matrix with convergence accuracy of 1e-2 is deemed to 
have converged on asymptotic growth when 10*8=80 consecutive iterations of the 
model have a growth within 1-1e-2=0.99 (i.e. 99%) and 1+1e-2=1.01 (i.e. 101%) 
of each other.
</p>
<p>If <code>vector</code> is specified, then the asymptotic growth of the projection of 
<code>vector</code> through <code>A</code> is returned. If <code>vector="n"</code> then 
asymptotic growths of the set of 'stage-biased' vectors are calculated. These 
projections are achieved using a set of standard basis vectors equal in number 
to the dimension of <code>A</code>. These have every element equal to 0, except for 
a single element equal to 1, i.e. for a matrix of dimension 3, the set of 
stage-biased vectors are: <code>c(1,0,0)</code>, <code>c(0,1,0)</code> and 
<code>c(0,0,1)</code>.
</p>
<p>Asymptotic growth should be equal to the dominant eigenvalue of the matrix. For
non-ergodic models this may not be the case: asymptotic growth will depend on
the population structure that's projected. <code>truelambda</code> provides a means
to check what the true asymptotic growth of a non-ergodic model is.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>vector</code> is specified, a numeric vector of length 2 giving the range in 
which asymptoticgrowth of the model lies.
</p>
<p>If <code>vector</code> is not specified, a 2-column matrix with each row giving the 
range in which asymptotic growth lies for its corresponding stage-biased 
projection: the number of rows is equal to the dimension of <code>A</code>; the first 
row is the range when projecting [1,0,0,...], the second entry is the range when 
projecting [0,1,0,...], etc.
