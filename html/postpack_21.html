<h2>Perform post-MCMC thinning</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Removes iterations from each chain of a <code>mcmc.list</code>
object at quasi-evenly spaced intervals. Post-MCMC thinning is useful for
developing long-running post-processing code with a smaller but otherwise identical <code>mcmc.list</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">post_thin(post, keep_percent, keep_iters)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>post</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>mcmc.list</code> object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep_percent</code></td>
<td>
<p>Proportion (between 0 and 1) of samples to keep from each chain.
Setting <code>keep_percent = 0.2</code> will remove approximately 80 percent of the samples.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep_iters</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of samples to keep from each chain.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The samples will be removed at as evenly spaced intervals
as possible, however, this is not perfect. It is therefore recommended
to use the full posterior for final post-processing calculations, but this should be fine for
most development of long-running code.
</p>
<p>If both <code>keep_percent</code> and <code>keep_iters</code> are supplied, an error will be returned requesting that only
one be used.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>mcmc.list</code> object, identical to <code>post</code>, but with fewer samples of each node.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Iteration numbers are reset after thinning the samples. So if running <code>post_dim()</code>
on output passed through <code>post_thin()</code>, you cannot trust the burn-in or thinning counts.
Again, this is not an issue for developing post-processing code.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># load example mcmc.list
data(cjs)

# take note of original dimensions
post_dim(cjs)

# keep ~20% of the samples
cjs_thin1 = post_thin(cjs, keep_percent = 0.2)

# note burn-in and thin intervals no longer correct!
# but desired outcome achieved - identical object but smaller
post_dim(cjs_thin1)

# keep 30 samples per chain
cjs_thin2 = post_thin(cjs, keep_iters = 30)
post_dim(cjs_thin2)
</code></pre>
