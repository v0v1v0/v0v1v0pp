<h2>Calculate summary statistics for propensity score weighting with clustering (for binary treatment only)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>SumStat_cl</code> is used to generate distributional plots of the estimated propensity scores and balance
diagnostics after propensity score weighting with two-level data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SumStat_cl(
  ps.formula = NULL,
  trtgrp = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  weight = "overlap",
  delta = 0,
  nAGQ = 1L
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ps.formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class <code>formula</code> (or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the propensity score model to be fitted. Additional details of model specification are given under "Details".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trtgrp</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional character defining the "treated" population for estimating the average treatment effect among the treated (ATT). Only necessary if <code>weight = "treated"</code>. This option can also be used to specify the treatment (in a two-treatment setting). Default value is the last group in the alphebatic order.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>an data frame containing the variables in the propensity score model. If not found in data, the variables are taken from <code>environment(formula)</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weight</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character or vector of characters including the types of weights to be used. <code>"IPW"</code> specifies the inverse probability weights for estimating the average treatment effect among the combined population (ATE). <code>"treated"</code> specifies the weights for estimating the average treatment effect among the treated (ATT). <code>"overlap"</code> specifies the (generalized) overlap weights for estimating the average treatment effect among the overlap population (ATO), or population at clinical equipoise. <code>"matching"</code> specifies the matching weights for estimating the average treatment effect among the matched population (ATM). <code>"entropy"</code> specifies the entropy weights for the average treatment effect of entropy weighted population (ATEN). Default is <code>"overlap"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>delta</code></td>
<td>
<p>trimming threshold for estimated (generalized) propensity scores. Should be no larger than 1 / number of treatment groups. Default is 0, corresponding to no trimming.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nAGQ</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer scalar - the number of points per axis for evaluating the adaptive Gauss-Hermite approximation to the log-likelihood.
Defaults to 1, corresponding to the Laplace approximation. Please refer to lme4 package for more details.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A typical form for <code>ps.formula</code> is <code>treatment ~ terms+1|clusters</code> where <code>treatment</code> is the treatment
variable, <code>terms</code> is a series of terms
which specifies a linear predictor for <code>treatment</code>, and <code>clusters</code> is the cluster indicator. The current version supports two-level models and the random-effects term is required to be the last piece in the formula. <code>ps.formula</code> specifies a mixed-effects logistic regression
model for estimating propensity scores. The treatment group corresponds to the last group in the alphebatic order, unless otherwise specified by <code>trtgrp</code>.
</p>
<p>Current version of <code>PSweight</code> allows for five types of propensity score weights used to estimate ATE (<code>"IPW"</code>), ATT (<code>"treated"</code>), and
ATO(<code>"overlap"</code>), ATM (<code>"matching"</code>) and ATEN (<code>"entropy"</code>). These weights are members of a larger class of balancing weights defined in Li, Morgan, and Zaslavsky (2018).
When there is a practical violation of the positivity assumption, <code>delta</code> defines the symmetric
propensity score trimming rule following Crump et al. (2009). With multiple treatments, <code>delta</code> defines the
multinomial trimming rule introduced in Yoshida et al. (2019). The overlap weights can also be considered as
a data-driven continuous trimming strategy without specifying trimming rules, see Li, Thomas and Li (2019).
Additional details on balancing weights and generalized overlap weights for multiple treatment groups are provided in
Li and Li (2019). For details about matching weights and entropy weights, please refer to Li and Greene (2013) and Zhou, Matsouaka and Thomas (2020).
