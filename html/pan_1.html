Dear Jing hua Zhao,

Thank You very much! This was just what I intended.
Of course you can include the example in the documentation. It's very good idea.


Best regards,

&gt; Dear Maria,
&gt;
&gt; I just had time to try out your data/code; is this close to what you intend?
&gt;
... 
&gt;
&gt; If you don't mind I could include your example in the documentation to 
&gt; let others share your experiment.
&gt;
&gt; Best wishes,
&gt;

Subject: Help for using R package PAN

Dear Jing hua Zhao,

I'm trying to use R package PAN. For one Y variable I have managed succesfully to 
impute using package PAN. When I try to impute two Y variables, I have encountered a 
problem that I can't solve. Could please help me? I'm not expert on R program and 
I'm really desperate.

I have R version 2.15.2 (Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)). Below is code 
that I have tried to run for two Y variables. There also the error message (Error: 
subscript out of bounds). I also attach the test data below after the R code.
