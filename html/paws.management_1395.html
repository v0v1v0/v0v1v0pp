<h2>Generates an activation code and activation ID you can use to register
your on-premises servers, edge devices, or virtual machine (VM) with
Amazon Web Services Systems Manager</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generates an activation code and activation ID you can use to register your on-premises servers, edge devices, or virtual machine (VM) with Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. Registering these machines with Systems Manager makes it possible to manage them using Systems Manager capabilities. You use the activation code and ID when installing SSM Agent on machines in your hybrid environment. For more information about requirements for managing on-premises machines using Systems Manager, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-hybrid-multicloud.html">Setting up Amazon Web Services Systems Manager for hybrid and multicloud environments</a> in the <em>Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide</em>.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Description</code></td>
<td>
<p>A user-defined description of the resource that you want to register
with Systems Manager.
</p>
<p>Don't enter personally identifiable information in this field.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>DefaultInstanceName</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the registered, managed node as it will appear in the Amazon
Web Services Systems Manager console or when you use the Amazon Web
Services command line tools to list Systems Manager resources.
</p>
<p>Don't enter personally identifiable information in this field.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>IamRole</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The name of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you want
to assign to the managed node. This IAM role must provide AssumeRole
permissions for the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager service
principal <code>ssm.amazonaws.com</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/hybrid-multicloud-service-role.html">Create an IAM service role for a hybrid and multicloud environment</a>
in the <em>Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide</em>.
</p>
<p>You can't specify an IAM service-linked role for this parameter. You
must create a unique role.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>RegistrationLimit</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specify the maximum number of managed nodes you want to register. The
default value is <code>1</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ExpirationDate</code></td>
<td>
<p>The date by which this activation request should expire, in timestamp
format, such as "2021-07-07T00:00:00". You can specify a date up to 30
days in advance. If you don't provide an expiration date, the activation
code expires in 24 hours.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Tags</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to
categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or
environment. For example, you might want to tag an activation to
identify which servers or virtual machines (VMs) in your on-premises
environment you intend to activate. In this case, you could specify the
following key-value pairs:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠Key=OS,Value=Windows⁠</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠Key=Environment,Value=Production⁠</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you install SSM Agent on your on-premises servers and VMs, you
specify an activation ID and code. When you specify the activation ID
and code, tags assigned to the activation are automatically applied to
the on-premises servers or VMs.
</p>
<p>You can't add tags to or delete tags from an existing activation. You
can tag your on-premises servers, edge devices, and VMs after they
connect to Systems Manager for the first time and are assigned a managed
node ID. This means they are listed in the Amazon Web Services Systems
Manager console with an ID that is prefixed with "mi-". For information
about how to add tags to your managed nodes, see
<code>add_tags_to_resource</code>. For information
about how to remove tags from your managed nodes, see
<code>remove_tags_from_resource</code>.</p>
