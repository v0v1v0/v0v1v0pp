<h2>PCS: Parallel Constraint Satisfaction networks in R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The PCS package contains all necessary functions for building and simulation
Parallel Constraint Satisfaction (PCS) network models within R.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><em>PCS models</em> are an increasingly used framework throughout psychology:
They provide quantitative predictions in a variety of paradigms, ranging from
word and letter recognition, for which they were originally developed
(McClelland &amp; Rumelhart, 1981; Rumelhart &amp; McClelland, 1982), to complex
judgments and decisions (Glöckner &amp; Betsch, 2008; Glöckner, Hilbig, &amp; Jekel,
2014), and many other applications besides.
</p>


<h3>Theoretical overview</h3>

<p>PCS networks embody the concept of <em>consistency maximization</em> in
perception and cognition, in that they assume that a cognitive system will
attempt to achieve a coherent state, in which all available information is
weighted to provide a maximally consistent representation of a given task.
Their central qualitative prediction follows from this basic assumption,
namely that the weights assigned to available information are reevaluated
during the decision process. These coherence shifts are a unique prediction
of PCS models, and have been found in multiple domains (c.f. Glöckner,
Betsch, &amp; Schindler, 2010; Holyoak &amp; Simon, 1999, Simon &amp; Holyoak, 2002).
</p>
<p>PCS models are implemented as neural networks, though they do not assume a
direct mapping from model nodes and connections onto neurons and dendrites.
Instead, the <em>nodes</em> represent concepts, and the <em>links</em> between
them the degree to which the concepts are compatible or reconcilable. The
assumption is that a PCS network is instantiated whenever a decision maker
faces a choice (Glöckner &amp; Betsch, 2008).
</p>
<p>At any given time, a node exhibits a certain level of <em>activation</em>,
which it passes through any present links to other nodes. If the level is
positive, the node is activated, otherwise it is labelled inhibited.
Activation is passed between nodes along the links, to varying degrees
depending on their strength and nature, which determines the spread of
activation in the network. Links can be excitatory, in that an activated
node on one side leads to an increasing activation of any connected node,
or inhibitory, in which connected nodes assume the opposite activation
level. Thus, nodes can be mutually supportive regarding their level of
activation, or restrain one another. Besides this qualitative difference,
links also differ in their weight, a number which denotes the proportion of
activation that is passed along the link. A link's magnitude captures the
connection weight, and its sign the qualitative type of influence
(excitatory or inhibitory). Links are always bidirectional, in that both
nodes reciprocally influence one another, in the same manner and to the
same extent.
</p>
<p>Within the network, processing occurs in discontinuous cycles,
<em>iterations</em>. In each cycle anew, nodes pass a proportion of their
activation level along the links to connected siblings. At each receiving
node, the total arriving activation is termed the total input. Because the
amount of activation passed through a link is multiplied by the link
weight, the total input is a weighted sum of the activation of all
connected nodes. The input does not, however, influence the node directly,
but instead is subject to two additional influences: First, the activation
of each node is reduced by a fixed proportion at each iteration, so that
the activation level <em>decays</em> to a fixed neutral point. Second, the
current activation level of the node determines the influence of the
arriving input: A node that is already active is less susceptible to
further excitatory input, and more so to external inhibition. The converse
holds for an inhibited node: Excitatory input is amplified, and further
inhibition dampened. These forces constrain the activation between a floor
and ceiling value.
</p>
<p>Together, these two forces determine the reaction of a node to input. In
particular, from their joint activity a non-linear <em>activation
function</em> emerges: The level of activation a node approches over many
interations is an s-shaped function of the input for excitatory links,
concave for positive and convex for negative input. For an inhibitory link,
this relationship is inverted.
</p>
<p>Activation initially enters a network through the <em>source node</em>, which
provides a constant level of activation. As activation enters the network
and is passed between nodes, the properties sketched above ensure that the
relationships between the concepts represented will increasingly be
satisfied, and after some time, the network reaches a stable state in which
nodes connected by excitatory links will share broadly similar levels of
activation, and those connected by inhibitory links dissimilar states.
Thus, the constraints represented in the network will be increasingly
satisfied (giving the model family its name), and the representation will
become <em>coherent</em>.
</p>
<p>When a network has converged into this state, <em>behavioral predictions</em>
can be derived: The number of iterations that passed during processing is
used as a proxy for decision time, of the nodes representing choice
alternatives, the one with the highest activation is assumed to be the
chosen one, and the difference between the activations of these nodes is
used to predict the confidence with which a decision is made or a course of
action taken.

<h3>Package contents</h3>

<p>This package contains all necessary simulation code to build and run PCS
models. In particular, it contains a full, optimized implementation of the
core model as specified by McClelland and Rumelhart (1981) as well as
Glöckner and Betsch (2008), as well as several variants commonly used in
the literature so that existing findings may be replicated.
</p>
<p><code>PCS_run</code> is the central function provided by the package. It
creates, and runs, a model of a PCS network given a connection matrix and
the necessary parameters.
