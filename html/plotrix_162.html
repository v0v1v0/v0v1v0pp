<h2>Triangle plot fill</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fill a triangle plot with smaller triangles.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> triax.fill(col)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>col</code></td>
<td>
<p>List of colors (see Details).</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In order for ‘<span class="samp">⁠triax.fill⁠</span>’ to fill an existing plot that has
been created by a call to ‘<span class="samp">⁠triax.plot⁠</span>’, the user must supply
a list of fill colors. The first element of the list must begin with
at least one value that can be interpreted as a color. The second
element must begin with at least three such values, and so on, adding
two values for each element of the list. Each list element will be
displayed as a row of colored triangles starting at the top of the
plot. The number of elements in the list determines the number of
rows that will be displayed.
