<h2>Methods for Function <code>subset</code> in Package <span class="pkg">performanceEstimation</span>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The method subset when applied to objects of class <code>ComparisonResults</code> can
be used to obtain another object of the same class with a subset of
the estimation results contained in the original object.
</p>


<h3>Methods</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>signature(x = "ComparisonResults")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The method has as first argument the object of class <code>ComparisonResults</code>
that you wish to subset. This method also includes 4 extra arguments that
you can use to supply the subsetting criteria.
</p>
<p>Namely, the parameter
<code>metrics</code> allows you to indicate a vector with the subset of
evaluation metrics in the orginal object. Alternatively, you can
provide a regular expression to be matched against the name
of the statistics measured in the experiment (see function
<code>metricNames</code>) to specify the subset of metrics 
you want to select.
</p>
<p>The parameter <code>workflows</code>
can be used to provide a vector with the subset of workflows
(approaches to the predictive tasks)
that are to be used in the sub-setting. Alternatively, you can also
provide a regular expression to be matched against the name
of the workflows (see function
<code>workflowNames</code>)  evaluated in the experiment to specify the subset
you want to select.
</p>
<p>The parameter <code>tasks</code>
allows you to indicate a vector with the subset of predictive tasks to be
extracted. Alternatively, you can
provide a regular expression to be matched against the name
of the tasks used in the experiment (see function
<code>taskNames</code>) to specify the subset
you want to select.
</p>
<p>Finally, the parameter <code>partial</code> allows you to control how the
names of the other parameters (tasks, workflows and metrics) are
matched against the original names in the <code>ComparisonResults</code>
object. It defaults to <code>TRUE</code> which means that the function
<code>grep</code> is used, whilst with <code>FALSE</code> the mathcin is
done using the function <code>match</code>. For instance, if you
have three metrics being estimated with names "F", "F1" and "F2",
and you call subset with <code>metrics="F"</code>, this would in effect
subset all three metrics, whilst with <code>partial=FALSE</code> only the
first of the three would be considered.
