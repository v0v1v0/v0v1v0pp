<h2>Declare <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>-specific attributes to data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>declare_attributes()</code> allows the user to
declare <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>-specific attributes to data they
bring from outside the package. This allows the user to use
package functions as shortcuts, where appropriate.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">declare_attributes(data, data_type, system, conflict_type)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame for which you want <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>-specific attributes</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, but a character vector of length 1 coinciding with the type of data the user believes
the data frame is. Options include: 'dyad_year', 'leader_day', 'leader_year', 'leader_dyad_year', 'state_day', or 'state_year'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>system</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, but a character vector of length 1 coinciding with the state system of the data. If specified at all,
must be 'cow' or 'gw'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>conflict_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, and applicable to just conflict data and the "whittle" class functions in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>. If specified,
must be a character vector of length 1 that is either 'cow' or 'gml'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function's documentation will include what attributes
are available to be declared. No doubt, the list of potential
attributes will grow in time, but the attributes that can be declared
are limited to just what I've built into the package to this
point. Users cannot declare more than one attribute of a given
type (i.e. a user cannot declare the system to be both Correlates of War
and Gleditsch-Ward).
</p>
<p>The idea here is, basically, to allow the user to use functions in
<span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> for data they have created or have acquired from
elsewhere. However, this functions provides <em>no</em> assurances about quality
control in the various merges built elsewhere into this package. This package
aggressively tests functions for data generated in-house. If your outside
data have merges, the various "add" functions may not perfectly perform. There
is no real way I can control for this since the data are coming from outside
the package and not through one of the "create" functions. In your particular
case, that may not be much of a problem. However, it's the user's
responsibility to do their own quality control in this situation.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>declare_attributes()</code> takes a data frame and
adds <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>-specific attributes to the data frame.
This will allow the user to take advantage of many of the
functions in this package without starting the process with one
of the "create" functions. If nothing is declared in the function,
no attribute is added and the function just returns the original
data without any change.

<pre><code class="language-R">
# just call `library(tidyverse)` at the top of the your script
library(magrittr)

data.frame(ccode = 2, year = c(1816:1830)) -&gt; usa_years

usa_years %&gt;% declare_attributes(data_type = 'state_year', system = 'cow')
