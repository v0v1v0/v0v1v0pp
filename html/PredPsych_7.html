<h2>Kinematics Dataset
A dataset containing part of the motion capture dataset freely available 
in the publication (Ansuini et al., 2015).The dataset was obtained by 
recording 15 naive participants performing reach-to-grasp movements towards 
two differently sized objects:  a small object (i.e., hazelnut) and a 
large object (i.e., grapefruit). The variables are as follows:</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> Object Size :                              Size of the to-be-grasped object
(1 = small, 2 = large)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Wrist_Velocity_01 .. Wrist_Height_10:      module of the velocity of the wrist marker
(mm/sec) from 10% (_01) to 100% (_10) of the movement
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Grip_Aperture_01 .. Grip_Aperture_10       Distance between the marker placed 
on thumb tip and that placed on the tip of the index finger (mm) from 10% (_01) 
to 100% (_10) of the movement
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Wrist_Height_01 .. Wrist_Height_10         z-component of the wrist marker (mm)
from 10% (_01) to 100% (_10) of the movement
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> x_index_01 .. x_index_10 :                 x-coordinates for the index with respect to F-local (mm) 
from 10% (_01) to 100% (_10) of the movement
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> y_index_01 .. y_index_10 :                 y-coordinates for the index with respect to F-local (mm) 
from 10% (_01) to 100% (_10) of the movement
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> z_index_01 .. z_index_10 :                 z-coordinates for the index with respect to F-local (mm) 
from 10% (_01) to 100% (_10) of the movement
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> x_thumb_01 .. x_thumb_10 :                 x-coordinates for the thumb with respect to F-local (mm) 
from 10% (_01) to 100% (_10) of the movement
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> y_thumb_01 .. y_thumb_10 :                 y-coordinates for the thumb with respect to F-local (mm) 
from 10% (_01) to 100% (_10) of the movement
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> z_thumb_01 .. z_thumb_10 :                 z-coordinates for the thumb with respect to F-local (mm) 
from 10% (_01) to 100% (_10) of the movement
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> x_finger_plane_01 .. x_finger_plane_10     x-components of the thumb-index plane
from 10% (_01) to 100% (_10) of the movement
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> y_finger_plane_01 .. y_finger_plane_10     y-components of the thumb-index plane
from 10% (_01) to 100% (_10) of the movement
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> z_finger_plane_01 .. z_finger_plane_10     z-components of the thumb-index plane
from 10% (_01) to 100% (_10) of the movement
</p>
</li>
