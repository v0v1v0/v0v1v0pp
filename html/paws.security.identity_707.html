<h2>Adds or updates the policy that is specified as the IAM role's
permissions boundary</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Adds or updates the policy that is specified as the IAM role's permissions boundary. You can use an Amazon Web Services managed policy or a customer managed policy to set the boundary for a role. Use the boundary to control the maximum permissions that the role can have. Setting a permissions boundary is an advanced feature that can affect the permissions for the role.
</p>

<p>A permissions boundary policy defines the maximum permissions that
identity-based policies can grant to an entity, but does not grant
permissions. Permissions boundaries do not define the maximum
permissions that a resource-based policy can grant to an entity. To
learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html">Permissions boundaries for IAM entities</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.
