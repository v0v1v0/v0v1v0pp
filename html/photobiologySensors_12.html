<h2>Angular response of sensors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A collection of angular response data for selected broadband
sensors used for measuring ultraviolet and visible radiation and of cosine
diffusers used with spectrometers. Each data frame in the
collection contains three variables, angle.deg (degrees) at either regular or
irregular intervals, response relative to the maximum (as a fraction of one)
and response relative to a perfect cosine response (as a fraction of one).
Data are either from manufacturer specifications or independent measurements
reported in the scientific literature.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">diffusers.lst
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>response_mspct</code> object containing a
<code>response_spct</code> objects as <em>named</em> members.
</p>
<p>Each member spectrum contains three variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> angle.deg (degrees)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> response (/1)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> response.over.cosine (/1)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Values are only good as reference, as individual sensors and diffusers
deviate to a smaller or larger extent from typical or mean responses for
their type. Variability is also reflected in some cases as an asymmetry in
opposite angles away from the vertical.
