<h2>
Read Genotype Data in POPDIST Format
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>read.POPDIST</code> reads one or more text files formatted for the
software POPDIST and produces a <code>"genambig"</code> object containing
genotypes, ploidies, and population identities from the file(s).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">read.POPDIST(infiles)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>infiles</code></td>
<td>

<p>A character vector of file paths to be read.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The format for the software POPDIST is a modified version of the
popular Genepop format.  The first line is a comment line, followed by
a list of locus names, each on a separate line or on one line
separated by commas.  A line starting with
the string “Pop” (“pop” and “POP” are also recognized)
indicates the beginning of data for one population.  Each individual
is then represented on one line, with the population name and
individual genotype separated by a tab followed by a comma.  Genotypes
for different
loci are separated by a tab or space.  Each allele must be coded by
two digits.  Zeros (“00”) indicate missing data, either for an
entire locus or for a partially heterozygous genotype.  Partially
heterozygous genotypes can also be represented by the arbitrary
duplication of alleles.
</p>
<p>If more than one file is read at once, locus names must be consistent
across all files.  Locus and population names should not start with “Pop”,
“pop”, or “POP”, as <code>read.POPDIST</code> searches for these
character strings in order to identify the lines that delimit populations.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>"genambig"</code> object.  The <code>Description</code> slot of the object
is taken from the comment line of the first file.  Locus names are taken
from the files, and samples are given numbers instead of names.  Each
genotype consists of all unique non-zero integers for a given sample and
locus.  The <code>Ploidies</code> slot is filled in based on how many alleles
are present at each locus of each sample (the number of characters
for the genotype, divided by two).  <code>reformatPloidies</code> is
used internally by the function to collapse the ploidies to the simplest
format.  Population names are taken from the
individual genotype lines, and population identities are recorded based
on how the individuals are delimited by “Pop” lines.
