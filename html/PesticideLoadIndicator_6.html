<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>substances</code></td>
<td>
<p>Dataframe describing active ingredients of the applied pesticide products and their CAS number.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>products</code></td>
<td>
<p>Dataframe with raw pesticide application data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>folder</code></td>
<td>
<p>Folder with exported xlsx files from PPDB containing information on active ingredient properties.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>healthrisk_off</code></td>
<td>
<p>Compute the Human Health risk sum score from the PPDb (default off).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Adds Ecotoxicity and Fate properties of active substances
needed to compute the Pesticide Load Indicator
to user-provided substance and product data frames.
Properties are based on information from the Pesticide Properties Database (PPDB),
which has to be provided by the user in Excel format (license required).
Note that the function can optionally also retrieve the
sum of risk scores for Human Health from the PPDB, based on
active ingredient-level risk phrases in the PPDB.
This is not recommended.
Best practice is to compute the sum of risk scores
based on risk phrases of the respective pesticide product
(see Kudsk et al., 2018 for weighing of respective risk phrases).
Product label information cannot be retrieved from the PPDB as labels
might be country-specific. Check national pesticide databases for
this information.
Note that you have to add teh reference value for sum.risk.scores, as follows,
if you select healthrisk_off=TRUE:
products$reference.sum.risk.scores &lt;- 300
