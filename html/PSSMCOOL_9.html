<h2>DMACA-PSSM feature</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In this feature each column of PSSM Matrix, can be regarded as a time series. Each PSSM
contains 20 columns Hence, each PSSM can be considered as 20 time series.The detrended moving-average
cross-correlation analysis (DMCA) is developed to measure the level of cross-correlation between two
non-stationary time series by fusing the detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) and the detrended
moving average(DMA).this function utilizes this algorithm for each column and each pair of columns to produce
a feature vector of length 290.
