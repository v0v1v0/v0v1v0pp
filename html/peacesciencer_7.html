<h2>Add Correlates of War major power information to a data frame</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_cow_majors()</code> allows you to add Correlates of War major power variables
to a dyad-year, leader-year, leader dyad-year, or state-year data frame.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_cow_majors(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with appropriate <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> attributes</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Be mindful that the data are fundamentally state-year and that extensions to leader-level data should be understood
as approximations for leaders in a given state-year.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_cow_majors()</code> takes a data frame and adds information
about major power status for the given state or dyad in that year. If the
data are dyad-year (or leader dyad-year), the function returns two
columns for whether the first state (i.e. <code>ccode1</code>) or the second
state (i.e. <code>ccode2</code>) are major powers in the given year, according
to the Correlates of War. 1 = is a major power. 0 = is not a major
power. If the data are state-year (or leader-year), the functions
returns just one column (<code>cowmaj</code>) for whether the
state was a major power in a given state-year.
