<h3>External formats</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> plink format: consists of three files, .bed, .bim and .fam. 
From <a href="https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats">https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats</a>:  The .bed 
files contain the  primary representation of genotype calls at biallelic 
variants in a binary format. The .bim is a text file with no header 
line, and one line  per variant with the following six fields: i) Chromosome 
code (either an integer, or 'X'/'Y'/'XY'/'MT'; '0' indicates unknown) or 
name, ii) Variant identifier, iii) Position in morgans or centimorgans (safe 
to use dummy value of '0'), iv) Base-pair coordinate (normally 1-based, but 
0 ok; limited to 231-2), v) Allele 1 (corresponding to clear bits in .bed; 
usually minor), vi) Allele 2 (corresponding to set bits in .bed; usually 
major). The .fam file is a text file with no header line, and one line per 
sample with the following six fields: i) Family ID ('FID'), ii), Within-
family ID ('IID'; cannot be '0'), iii) Within-family ID of father ('0' if 
father isn't in dataset, iv) within-family ID of mother ('0' if mother isn't 
in dataset), v) sex code ('1' = male, '2' = female, '0' = unknown), vi) 
Phenotype value ('1' = control, '2' = case, '-9'/'0'/non-numeric = missing 
data if case/control)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> snptest format: consists of two files, the genotype file ending in .gen 
(genotypes_snptest.gen) and the sample file ending in .sample 
(Ysim_snptest.sample). From
<a href="https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/snptest/#input_file_formats">https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/snptest/#input_file_formats</a>:
The genotype file stores data on a one-line-per-SNP format. The first 5 
entries of each line should be the SNP ID, RS ID of the SNP, base-pair 
position of the SNP, the allele coded A and the allele coded B. The SNP ID 
can be used to denote the chromosome number of each SNP. The next three 
numbers on the line should be the probabilities of the three genotypes AA, 
AB and BB at the SNP for the first individual in the cohort. The next three 
numbers should be the genotype probabilities for the second individual in the 
cohort. The next three numbers are for the third individual and so on. The 
order of individuals in the genotype file should match the order of the 
individuals in the sample file. The sample file has three parts (a) a header 
line detailing the names of the columns in the file, (b) a line detailing the 
types of variables stored in each column, and (c) a line for each individual 
detailing the information for that individual. 
a) The header line needs a minimum of three entries. The first three entries 
should always be ID_1, ID_2 and missing. They denote that the first three 
columns contain the first ID, second ID and missing data proportion of each 
individual. Additional entries on this line should be the names of covariates 
or phenotypes that are included in the file. In the above example, there are 
4 covariates named cov_1, cov_2, cov_3, cov_4, a continuous phenotype named 
pheno1 and a binary phenotype named bin1. All phenotypes should appear after 
the covariates in this file. b) The second line (the variable type line) 
details the type of variables included in each column. The first three 
entries of this line should be set to 0. Subsequent entries in this line for 
covariates and phenotypes should be specified by the following rules: D for
Discrete covariates (coded using positive integers), C for Continuous 
covariates, P for Continuous Phenotype, B for Binary Phenotype (0 = Controls, 
1 = Cases). c) Individual information: one line for each individual 
containing the information specified by the entries of the header line.
Entries of the sample file are separated by spaces.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> bimbam format: consists of a) a simple, tab-separated phenotype file
without sample or phenotype header/index (Ysim_bimbam.txt) and b) the mean
genotype file format which is a single file, without information on
individuals: (genotypes.bimbam). From the bimbam documentation at
<a href="http://www.haplotype.org/software.html">http://www.haplotype.org/software.html</a>: The first column of the mean
genotype files is the SNP ID, the second and third columns are allele types
with minor allele first. The rest columns are the mean genotypes of different
individuals – numbers between 0 and 2 that represents the (posterior) mean
genotype, or dosage of the minor allele. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> gemma format: consists of a) a
simple, tab-separated phenotype file without sample or phenotype header/index
(Ysim_gemma.txt) and b) the mean genotype file format which is a single file,
without information on individuals(genotypes.gemma); a) and b) both the same
as above for bimbam format). In addition and if applicable, c) a kinship file
(kinship_gemma.txt) and d) covariate file (Covs_gemma.txt). From
<a href="http://www.xzlab.org/software/GEMMAmanual.pdf">http://www.xzlab.org/software/GEMMAmanual.pdf</a>: The kinship file
contains a NrSample × NrSample matrix, where each row and each column
corresponds to individuals in the same order as in the mean genotype file,
and ith row and jth column is a number indicating the relatedness value
between ith and jth individuals. The covariates file has the same format as
the phenotype file dsecribed above and must contain a column of 1’s if one
wants to include an intercept term (set parameter intercept_gemma=TRUE).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> limmbo format: consists of a) a comma-separated phenotype file without
sample IDs as index and phenotype IDs as header (Ysim_limmbo.csv), b) the
mean genotype file format with one genetic variant per line. The first column
contains the variant ID, column 2-N+1 contain the genotype code (numbers
between 0 and 2 that represent the (posterior) mean genotype/dosage of the
minor allele) for N samples, c)  a kinship file (kinship_limmbo.csv) and d)
covariate file (covs_limmbo.csv). From
