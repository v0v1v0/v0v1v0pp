<h2>Simulate Data from Rasch Mixture Models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generate simulated data from mixtures of Rasch models. The latent
classes of the mixture can differ regarding size as well as item and
person parameters of the corresponding Rasch model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  simRaschmix(design, extremes = FALSE, attributes = TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>design</code></td>
<td>
<p>Type of data generating process. Can be provided as a
character or a named list. See Details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>extremes</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Should observations with none or all items
solved be included in the data?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>attributes</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Should the true group membership as well as
true item and person parameters be attached to the data as attributes
<code>"cluster"</code>, <code>"difficulty"</code>, and <code>"ability"</code>?</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>design</code> of the data generating process (DGP) can be provided
in essentially three different ways.
</p>
<p>If the <code>design</code> argument is one of <code>"rost1"</code>, <code>"rost2"</code>
or <code>"rost3"</code>, responses from the three DGPs introduced in Rost
(1990) will be drawn.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the <code>design</code> can be provided as a named list with
elements <code>nobs</code>, <code>weights</code>, <code>ability</code>, and
<code>difficulty</code>.
The <code>weights</code> can be provided in three formats: If provided as a
vector of probabilities (summing to 1), class membership will be drawn
with these probabilities. If <code>weights</code> is a vector of integer weights
(summing to <code>nobs</code>, or an integer division thereof), Class sizes
will be either the weights directly or a multiple thereof. As a third
alternative, the <code>weights</code> can be provided as a
function of the number of observations (<code>nobs</code>).
The <code>ability</code> specification can also be provided in three
formats: If provided as a matrix of dimension 2xk with mean and
standard deviation for each of the k clusters, the ability parameters
are drawn from a normal distribution with the corresponding parameters.
Second, <code>ability</code> can be an array of dimension (., 2, k) with abilities
and corresponding weights/probabilities per cluster. Third, it can
also be provided as a list of k functions which take the number of
observations as an argument.
The specification of the item <code>difficulty</code> can be
provided either as a matrix with k columns with the item
difficulties per cluster or as a matrix with <code>nobs</code> rows with the item
difficulties per subject.
</p>
<p>As a third option, <code>design</code> may also be a named list containing a
vector of <code>ability</code> parameters and a matrix
<code>difficulty</code> of dimension (number of observation x number of items).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix of item responses with dimension (number of observations x
number of items).
If <code>attributes = TRUE</code>, the matrix has attributes <code>cluster</code>,
<code>ability</code>, and <code>difficulty</code>. The class memberships
<code>cluster</code> are only returned when not provided implicitly through
and a vector of abilties and a difficulty matrix with entries for each
subject.
