<h2>Evaluate boundary length of solution</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate the exposed boundary length (i.e., perimeter) associated with a
solution to a conservation planning problem.
This summary statistic is useful for evaluating the spatial fragmentation of
planning units selected within a solution.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">eval_boundary_summary(
  x,
  solution,
  edge_factor = rep(0.5, number_of_zones(x)),
  zones = diag(number_of_zones(x)),
  data = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>problem()</code> object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>solution</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>numeric</code>, <code>matrix</code>, <code>data.frame</code>,
<code>terra::rast()</code>, or <code>sf::sf()</code> object.
The argument should be in the same format as the planning unit cost
data in the argument to <code>x</code>.
See the Solution format section for more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>edge_factor</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>numeric</code> proportion to scale
planning unit edges (borders) that do not have any neighboring planning
units. For example, an edge factor of <code>0.5</code> is commonly used to
avoid overly penalizing planning units along a coastline.
Note that this argument must have an element for each zone in the argument
to <code>x</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>zones</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>matrix</code> or <code>Matrix</code> object describing the
clumping scheme for different zones. Each row and column corresponds to a
different zone in the argument to <code>x</code>, and cell values indicate the
relative importance of clumping planning units that are allocated to
a combination of zones. Cell values along the diagonal of the matrix
represent the relative importance of clumping planning units that are
allocated to the same zone. Cell values must range between 1 and -1, where
negative values favor solutions that spread out planning units. The default
argument to <code>zones</code> is an identity
matrix (i.e., a matrix with ones along the matrix diagonal and zeros
elsewhere), so that penalties are incurred when neighboring planning units
are not assigned to the same zone. If the cells along
the matrix diagonal contain markedly smaller values than those found
elsewhere in the matrix, then solutions are preferred that surround
planning units with those allocated to different zones
(i.e., greater spatial fragmentation).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>NULL</code>, <code>data.frame</code>, <code>matrix</code>, or <code>Matrix</code>
object containing the boundary data. These data describe the total
amount of boundary (perimeter) length  for each planning unit,
and the amount of boundary (perimeter) length shared between different
planning units (i.e., planning units that are adjacent to each other).
See the Data format section for more information.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This summary statistic is equivalent to the <code>Connectivity_Edge</code> metric
reported by the <a href="https://marxansolutions.org"><em>Marxan</em> software</a>
(Ball <em>et al.</em> 2009).
It is calculated using the same equations used to penalize solutions
according to their total exposed boundary (i.e., <code>add_boundary_penalties()</code>).
See the Examples section for examples on how differences <code>zone</code> arguments
can be used to calculate boundaries for different combinations of zones.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>tibble::tibble()</code> object containing the boundary length of the
solution.
It contains the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>summary</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>character</code> description of the summary statistic.
The statistic associated with the <code>"overall"</code> value
in this column is calculated using the entire solution
(including all management zones if there are multiple zones).
If multiple management zones are present, then summary statistics
are also provided for each zone separately
(indicated using zone names).</p>
</dd>
<dt>boundary</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>numeric</code> exposed boundary length value.
Greater values correspond to solutions with greater
boundary length and, in turn, greater spatial fragmentation.
Thus conservation planning exercises typically prefer solutions
with smaller values.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Data format</h3>

<p>The argument to <code>data</code> can be specified using the following formats.
Note that boundary data must always describe symmetric relationships
between planning units.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>data</code> as a <code>NULL</code> value</dt>
<dd>
<p>indicating that the data should be
automatically calculated using the <code>boundary_matrix()</code> function.
This argument is the default.
Note that the boundary data must be supplied
using one of the other formats below if the planning unit data
in the argument to <code>x</code> do not explicitly contain spatial information
(e.g., planning unit data are a <code>data.frame</code> or <code>numeric</code> class).</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>data</code> as a <code>matrix</code>/<code>Matrix</code> object</dt>
<dd>
<p>where rows and columns represent
different planning units and the value of each cell represents the
amount of shared boundary length between two different planning units.
Cells that occur along the matrix diagonal denote the total
boundary length associated with each planning unit.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>data</code> as a <code>data.frame</code> object</dt>
<dd>
<p>with the columns <code>"id1"</code>,
<code>"id2"</code>, and <code>"boundary"</code>. The <code>"id1"</code> and <code>"id2"</code> columns contain
identifiers (indices) for a pair of planning units, and the <code>"boundary"</code>
column contains the amount of shared boundary length between these
two planning units.
Additionally, if the values in the <code>"id1"</code> and <code>"id2"</code> columns
contain the same values, then the value denotes the
amount of exposed boundary length (not total boundary).
This format follows the the standard <em>Marxan</em> format for boundary
data (i.e., per the "bound.dat" file).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Solution format</h3>

<p>Broadly speaking, the argument to <code>solution</code> must be in the same format as
the planning unit data in the argument to <code>x</code>.
Further details on the correct format are listed separately
for each of the different planning unit data formats:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>x</code> has <code>numeric</code> planning units</dt>
<dd>
<p>The argument to <code>solution</code> must be a
<code>numeric</code> vector with each element corresponding to a different planning
unit. It should have the same number of planning units as those
in the argument to <code>x</code>. Additionally, any planning units missing
cost (<code>NA</code>) values should also have missing (<code>NA</code>) values in the
argument to <code>solution</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>x</code> has <code>matrix</code> planning units</dt>
<dd>
<p>The argument to <code>solution</code> must be a
<code>matrix</code> vector with each row corresponding to a different planning
unit, and each column correspond to a different management zone.
It should have the same number of planning units and zones
as those in the argument to <code>x</code>. Additionally, any planning units
missing cost (<code>NA</code>) values for a particular zone should also have a
missing (<code>NA</code>) values in the argument to <code>solution</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>x</code> has <code>terra::rast()</code> planning units</dt>
<dd>
<p>The argument to <code>solution</code>
be a <code>terra::rast()</code> object where different grid cells (pixels) correspond
to different planning units and layers correspond to
a different management zones. It should have the same dimensionality
(rows, columns, layers), resolution, extent, and coordinate reference
system as the planning units in the argument to <code>x</code>. Additionally,
any planning units missing cost (<code>NA</code>) values for a particular zone
should also have missing (<code>NA</code>)  values in the argument to <code>solution</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>x</code> has <code>data.frame</code> planning units</dt>
<dd>
<p>The argument to <code>solution</code> must
be a <code>data.frame</code> with each column corresponding to a different zone,
each row corresponding to a different planning unit, and cell values
corresponding to the solution value. This means that if a <code>data.frame</code>
object containing the solution also contains additional columns, then
these columns will need to be subsetted prior to using this function
(see below for example with <code>sf::sf()</code> data).
Additionally, any planning units missing cost
(<code>NA</code>) values for a particular zone should also have missing (<code>NA</code>)
values in the argument to <code>solution</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>x</code> has <code>sf::sf()</code> planning units</dt>
<dd>
<p>The argument to <code>solution</code> must be
a <code>sf::sf()</code> object with each column corresponding to a different
zone, each row corresponding to a different planning unit, and cell values
corresponding to the solution value. This means that if the
<code>sf::sf()</code> object containing the solution also contains additional
columns, then these columns will need to be subsetted prior to using this
function (see below for example).
Additionally, the argument to <code>solution</code> must also have the same
coordinate reference system as the planning unit data.
Furthermore, any planning units missing cost
(<code>NA</code>) values for a particular zone should also have missing (<code>NA</code>)
values in the argument to <code>solution</code>.
