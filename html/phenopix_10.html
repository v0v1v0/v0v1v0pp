<h2>
Convert a region of interest object from the old structure to the new (phenopix &gt; 2.4)

</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows to convert the <code>roi.data</code> stored  in the <code>roi.data.Rdata</code> object built with 
<code>phenopix</code> older than version 2.4 into the new structure better described in the details section. The 
changed was needed because a new method for drawing a region of interest was conceived, which includes the 
possibility to draw multiple polygons for a single ROI. The new function that does the job is 
<code>DrawMULTIROI</code>, which fully substitutes the old <code>DrawROI</code>.  

</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">convertROI(path_img_ref, path_ROIs, file.type='.jpg')
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path_img_ref</code></td>
<td>

<p>Path in your folder for the reference image

</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path_ROIs</code></td>
<td>

<p>Path where <code>roi.data</code> object created with <code>phenopix</code> &lt; 2.4 was built.

</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file.type</code></td>
<td>

<p>It must match the syntax of your file extension (e.g. .jpg, .JPG, .JPEG). Multiple types are allowed by concatenation with c().

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function allows to convert the <code>roi.data</code> stored  in the <code>roi.data.Rdata</code> object built with 
phenopix older than version 2.4 into the new structure better described in the details section. The changed 
was needed because a new method for drawing a region of interest was conceived, which includes the possibility 
of drawing multiple polygons for a single ROI. There is a second reason why DrawROI had to disappear: it 
included C++ code from the package SDMTools which is currently orphaned.  The new function that allows multiple 
polygons in a single ROI is <code>DrawMULTIROI</code>, which fully substitutes the old <code>DrawROI</code>.

</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing the following: 
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mask</code></td>
<td>
<p>A binary mask (a raster object)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>polygons</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class SpatialPolygons</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Additionally, a jpeg image is returned with the ROI(s) drawn. 
The same object that is returned is saved in the path specified in <code>path_ROIs</code>
