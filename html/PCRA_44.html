<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data for the S&amp;P® 400 Industrials is taken from a paper copy of the 
S&amp;P® Analysts' Handbook published in 1988. The average price level of the
index in 1941-1943 was set to 10. The index is based on 70 individual groups,
and price information on it was backfilled to 1918, though we do not have 
access to it. The original S&amp;P® 500 index was created in late February 1957 
and included 425 industrial stocks, 15 rail stocks and 60 utility stocks. 
In July 1976, financial stocks were added to the index, which now included
400 industrials, 40 utilities, 40 finance and 20 transport stocks. It is 
possible that the pre-1967 history was recreated by S&amp;P® for the Analysts' 
Handbook. See https://globalfinancialdata.com/the-sp-composite-before-1957
for a useful history of the various S&amp;P® indices.
