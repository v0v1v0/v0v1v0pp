<h2>Example 12â€“Advective and Diffusive Flux of Heat and Solutes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This example demonstrates the capability of PHREEQC to
calculate transient transport of heat and solutes in a column or along a 1D
flowline. A column is initially filled with a dilute KCl solution at 25
degrees C in equilibrium with a cation exchanger. A KNO3 solution then
advects into the column and establishes a new temperature of 0 degrees C.
Subsequently, a sodium chloride solution at 24 degrees C is allowed to
diffuse from both ends of the column, assuming no heat is lost through the
column walls. At one end, a constant boundary condition is imposed, and at
the other end, the final cell is filled with the sodium chloride solution
and a closed boundary condition is prescribed. For the column end with a
constant boundary condition, an analytical solution is compared with PHREEQC
results, for unretarded Cl- (R = 1.0) and retarded Na+ and temperature
(R = 3.0). Finally, the second-order accuracy of the numerical method is
verified by increasing the number of cells by a factor of three and
demonstrating a decrease in the error of the numerical solution by
approximately one order of magnitude relative to the analytical solution.
The example can be run using the <code>phrRunString</code> routine.
