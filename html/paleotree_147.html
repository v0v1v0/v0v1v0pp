<h2>Cladogram and Range Data for the Retiolitinae</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The majority rule consensus cladogram for 22 genera from the Retiolitinae, a
clade of Silurian retiolitids, along with discrete time interval data
taken from the same publication (Bates et al., 2005). Additional character state
data are included for three major, binary-state morphological traits.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This dataset is composed of three objects:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>retioTree</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The consensus cladogram, given as an object of class <code>phylo</code>.</p>
</dd> 
<dt><code>retioRanges</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A list containing two matrices. The first matrix describes the first
and last interval times for 20 Silurian graptolite zones and the second matrix describes when the
various genera on the cladogram first and last appear in those graptolite zones. (In other words,
<code>retioRanges</code> has the <code>timeList</code> format called by some <code>paleotree</code> functions).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>retioChar</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A matrix containing binary presence-absence character states for these 22
Retiolitinae genera for three characters which they vary in: the presence of extrathecal threads
(note only one taxon lacks this character state), the presence of determinant growth and the
secondary loss of a nema via resorption. Note these character do not vary within these genera.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Interval dates were taken from Sadler et al. (2009). These zones were not a
1-1 match to those in Bates et al., so it took some merging and splitting by
the package author, so buyer beware.
</p>
<p>Character data are from an in prep manuscript containing character data for certain
major morphological innovations of graptoloids, coded for a large number of genera based
on an extensive survey of the published descriptions. The character data presented here
is a small subset of the full dataset.
