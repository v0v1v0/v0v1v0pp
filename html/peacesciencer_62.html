<h2>Directed Leader-Dyadic Dispute-Year Data with No Duplicate Leader-Dyad-Years (GML, v. 2.2.1, Archigos v. 4.1)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are directed leader-dyadic dispute year data derived from the Gibler-Miller-Little (GML) Militarized Interstate
Dispute (MID) project. Data are from version 2.2.1 (GML-MID) and version 4.1 (Archigos).
These were whittled to where there is no duplicate dyad-years.
Its primary aim here is merging into a dyad-year data frame.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The process of creating these is described at one of the references below. Importantly, these data are somewhat
"naive." That is: they won't tell you, for example, that Brazil and Japan never directly fought each other during World War II.
Instead, it will tell you that there were two years of overlap for the two on different sides of the conflict and that the highest
action for both was a war. The data are thus similar to what the <code>EUGene</code> program would create for users back in the day. Use these
data with that limitation in mind.
</p>
<p>Data were created by first selecting on unique onsets. Then, where duplicates remained: retaining highest fatality, highest hostility level,
highest estimated minimum duration, reciprocated observations over unreciprocated observations, and, finally, the lowest start month.
</p>
<p>Be mindful that Archigos' leader data are nominally denominated in Gleditsch-Ward states, which are standardized to Correlates of War
state system membership as well as the data can allow. There will be some missing leaders after 1870 because Archigos is ultimately its
own system.
