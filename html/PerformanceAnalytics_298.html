<h2>calculate Upside Potential Ratio of upside performance over downside risk</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sortino proposed an improvement on the Sharpe Ratio to better account for
skill and excess performance by using only downside semivariance as the
measure of risk.  That measure is the <code>SortinoRatio</code>. This
function, Upside Potential Ratio, was a further improvement, extending the
measurement of only upside on the numerator, and only downside of the
denominator of the ratio equation.

<p>calculate Upside Potential Ratio of upside performance over downside risk
</p>
<p>Sortino proposed an improvement on the Sharpe Ratio to better account for
skill and excess performance by using only downside semivariance as the
measure of risk.  That measure is the <code>SortinoRatio</code>. This
function, Upside Potential Ratio, was a further improvement, extending the
measurement of only upside on the numerator, and only downside of the
denominator of the ratio equation.
</p>
<p>Sortino contends that risk should be measured in terms of not meeting the
investment goal.  This gives rise to the notion of “Minimum
Acceptable Return” or MAR.  All of Sortino's proposed measures include the
MAR, and are more sensitive to downside or extreme risks than measures that
use volatility(standard deviation of returns) as the measure of risk.
</p>
<p>Choosing the MAR carefully is very important, especially when comparing
disparate investment choices.  If the MAR is too low, it will not adequately
capture the risks that concern the investor, and if the MAR is too high, it
will unfavorably portray what may otherwise be a sound investment.  When
comparing multiple investments, some papers recommend using the risk free
rate as the MAR.  Practitioners may wish to choose one MAR for consistency,
several standardized MAR values for reporting a range of scenarios, or a MAR
customized to the objective of the investor.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn"> UPR=\frac{ \sum^{n}_{t=1} (R_{t} - MAR) }{ \delta_{MAR} } </code>
</p>
<p> where
<code class="reqn">\delta_{MAR}</code> is the <code>DownsideDeviation</code>.
</p>
<p>The numerator in <code>UpsidePotentialRatio</code> only uses returns that exceed
the MAR, and the denominator (in <code>DownsideDeviation</code>) only uses
returns that fall short of the MAR by default.  Sortino contends that this
is a more accurate and balanced protrayal of return potential, wherase
<code>SortinoRatio</code> can reward managers most at the peak of a cycle,
without adequately penalizing them for past mediocre performance.  Others
have used the full series, and this is provided as an option by the
<code>method</code> argument.
