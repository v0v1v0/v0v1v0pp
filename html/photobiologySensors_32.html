<h2>sglux broadband sensors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A vector of indexes for extracting subsets of spectra from the
<code>sensors.mspct</code> object.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sglux_sensors
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A character vector of members of the collection of spectra.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>sglux SG01D-A UV-A broadband sensor (filtered SiC sensor).
</p>
<p>sglux SG01D-B UV-B broadband sensor (filtered SiC sensor, VIS-blind).
</p>
<p>sglux SG01D-C UV-C broadband sensor (filtered SiC sensor, "solar-blind").
</p>
<p>sglux SG01L SiC broadband sensor (SiC sensor not filtered).
</p>
<p>sglux TOCON blue 4 blue light broadband sensor (pre-amplified GaP detector).
</p>
<p>TOCON preamplified sensors with similar spectral response as the diodes are
also available from sglux. The blue light sensor is only available as
preamplified TOCON. Sensors are available in different configurations with
different sensitivity and with different angular responses, and encased
to resist different environmental conditions.
