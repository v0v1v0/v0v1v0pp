<h2>
Ensemble power or sample size under selected control of the FDP 
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a function for calculating two differing notions of power, or deriving sample
sizes for specified requisite power in multiple testing experiments under a variety of methods for
control of the distribution of the False Discovery Proportion (FDP). More specifically, one can
choose to control the FDP distribution according to control of its (i) mean, e.g. the usual BH-FDR
procedure, or via the probability that it exceeds a given value, delta, via (ii) the Romano
procedure, or via (iii) my procedure based upon asymptotic approximation. Likewise, we can think of
the power in multiple testing experiments in terms of a summary of the distribution of the
True Positive Proportion (TPP). The package will compute power, sample size or any other missing
parameter required for power based upon (i) the mean of the TPP which is the average power
(ii) the probability that the TPP exceeds a given value, lambda, via my asymptotic approximation
procedure. The theoretical results are described in Izmirlian, G. (2020), and an applied paper 
describing the methodology with a simulation study is in preparation.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>FDP.control.method</code></td>
<td>

<p>A character string specifying how the false discovery proportion (FDP) is to be
controlled. You may specify the whole word or any shortened uniquely
identifying truncation. <br>
"BHFDR": the usual BH-FDR <br>
"BHCLT": use asymptotic approximation to the distribution of the FDP 
to find a smaller FDR which guarantees probability less
than alpha that the FDP exceeds alpha. <br>
"Romano": use Romano's method which guarantees probability less than 
alpha that the FDP exceeds alpha. <br>
"Auto": in 'FixedPoint' mode, the program will use its own 
wisdom to determine which choice above to make. The 
order of conservatism is Romano &gt; BHCLT &gt; BHFDR, but 
BHFDR offers only expected control while the other two 
guarantee bounds on the excedance probabilty. If the 
distribution of the FDP is nearly degenerate, then BHFDR 
is the best option. Otherwise, if it can be reliably used, 
BHCLT would be the best choice. The 'effective' denominator, 
gamma*N.tests, in the CLT determines when the approximation 
is good enough and the asymptotic standard error of the FDP 
determines when the distribution is dispersed enough to matter.
Use "Auto" to run through these checks and determine the best. 
A return argument, 'Auto', displays the choice made. See 
output components and details. <br>
"both": in 'simulation' mode, compute statistics R and T under BHCLT
and Romano (in addition to BHFDR). Corresponding
statistics are denoted R.st, T.st corresponding to BHCLT
control of the FDP, and R.R and T.R corresponding to
Romano control of the FDP. If sim.level is set to 2,
(default) the statistics R.st.ht and T.st.ht, which are
the number rejected and number true positives under BHCLT
where r_0 = 1-r_1, gamma, and alpha.star have been estimated 
from the P-value data and then alpha.star computed from
these.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specify the method whereby the average power is calculated. 
You may specify the whole word or any unqiuely indentifying  
truncation.<br>
"FixedPoint": use the fixed point method, e.g., 
first find the solution to the equation u = G(alpha u) where 
G is the CDF of the pooled P-values. This solution gives 
'gamma', the positive proportion. The average power and other 
quantities are then determined e.g. 
average.power = G_1( gamma alpha), where G_1 is the CDF of the 
P-values corresponding to statistics drawn under H_A. <br>
"simulation": uses brute force simulation to determine the average power.
NOTE: the "FixedPoint" technique is approximate in that it 
results in large sample values.

'tol' is a convergence criterion used in iterative 
methods which is set to 1e-8 by default.
'max.iter' is an iteration limit, set to 20 for the iterated
function limit and 1000 for all others by default.
'distop', specifying the distribution family of the central

gives normal (2 groups), distop=2 gives t- (2 groups)
and distopt=3 gives F- (2+ groups) <br>
'CS', correlation structure, for use only with 'method="simulation"'  
which will simulate m simulatenous tests with correlations 
'rho' in blocks of size 'n.WC'. Specify as a list
CS = list(rho=0.80,n.WC=50) for example.  <br>
'sim.level' sim level 2 (default) stipulates, when FDP.control.method
is set to "BHCLT", or "both", R.st.ht and T.st.ht are
computed in addition to R.st and T.st (see above). <br>
'low.power.stop' in simulation option, will result in an error message

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function will compute one of a variety of ensemble powers
under a given choice of FDP control methods. The underlying
model assumes that the m simultaneous test statistics are
i.i.d., each being formed from k samples which can be paired
(k=2), balanced or unbalanced (k&gt;=2), k=1,2,..., and distributed
according to one of the available relevent distribution types
(see above). The location parameter for each of the statistical
tests is either 0 (null hypothesis) or a specified constant
effect size (alternative hypothesis), with the identity of these
two possibilities in each of the m cases being an i.i.d. unmeasured 
latent bernouli variable with density r.1, the mixing
proportion. The m simultaneous statistical tests partition into
those which are distributed according to the alternative,
numbering M_m, and those distributed according to the NULL,
numbering m-M_m. Once a selected thresholding method is
applied, the m statistics can also be partitioned into those
which are called significant, numbering R_m, and those which
are not, numbering m-R_m. Each of the test statistics is thus
given two labels, alternative hypothesis membership and whether
a significant call was made. Of the R_m significant calls, T_m
are true positives and V_m are false positives. This results in
the following table.

<p>The ratio of the false positive count to the significant call
count, V_m/R_m, is called the False Discovery Proportion
(FDP). Thresholding methods which result in the most 
reproducibility seek to control the FDP distribution. The most
well known is the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate
(BH-FDR) procedure. It guarantees that the FDR, which is the
expected FDP, will be less than a stipulated alpha
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">E[ V_m / R_m ] &lt; \alpha</code>
</p>
<p>While it is true that for large m, the distribution of the FDP,
V_m/M_m will become spiked at its mean, <code class="reqn">(1-r_1)\alpha</code>, in
many commonly occuring situations, there will still be
non-negligible dispersion in the distribution of the FDP. For
this reason, any validity promised by the BH-FDR procedure does
not actually apply on a case to case basis, and individual FDP's
may differ non-negligibly from the FDR. For this reason, the
function supplies two other methods of FDP control in addition to
FDP.control.method="BHFDR". These two alternate methods,
FDP.control.method="Romano" and FDP.control.method="BHCLT"
guarantee control of the tail probability of the FDP
distribution:
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">P\{ V_m/R_m &gt; \delta \} &lt; \alpha</code>
</p>
<p>The lower bound <code class="reqn">\delta</code> is left arbitrary for greater
flexibility, <code class="reqn">\delta=\alpha</code> being the default. There is
also an automatic option, FDP.control.method="Auto", which lets
the function decide which of the three FDP control methods is
the most advisable in a given situation. The two tail
probability control options are preferred when the standard
error of the FDP exceeds a cutoff given in the default
'control' settings:
</p>
<p>se[V_m/R_m] / alpha &gt; FDP.cntl.mth.thrsh.def[1]
</p>
<p>The default is 10%. When the standard error to alpha ratio is
10% or less then the BHFDR, being the least conservative, is
preferred. When the se to alpha ratio is 10% or more, then
Romano and BHCLT are decided between, with the BHCLT (asymptotic
approximation) being less conservative than Romano and therefor
preferred if the CLT approximation is adequate. This will be the
case provided <code class="reqn">m</code> is large enough,
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">m \geq</code> FDP.cntl.mth.thrsh.def[2]. The default is 50. 
</p>
<p>The concept of ensemble power for the purposes of this function,
concern the distribution of the true positive proportion (TPP),
<code class="reqn">T_m/M_m</code>. The most well known is the average power, which
is the expected value of the TPP, which is called the true
positve rate (TPR):
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">E[ T_m/M_m ] = average power</code>
</p>
<p>For large m, the distribution of the TPP will be spiked at its
mean, which is the asymptotic average power. This is used in
the function in the average power computation. As was the case
for the FDP, there are many commonly occuring situations when
the distribution of the TPP will still be non-negligibly
dispersed. For this reason, we provide an alternate notion of
power which is based upon the tail probability of the TPP
distribution: 
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">P\{ T_m/M_m &gt; \lambda \} = tp-power</code>
</p>
<p>This is computed via asymptotic approximation and also requires
that <code class="reqn">m</code> be large enough: <code class="reqn">m &gt; 50</code>. The user decides
when the tp-power is to be preferred. A good check is to look
at the ratio of the se[TPP] to average power ratio which is the
sigma.rtm.TPP/average.power/N.tests^0.5 If this ratio is
unacceptibly large (10% or so) than the tp-power is preferred.
</p>
<p>For the "FixedPoint" method (default) and for any specified choice 
of FDP.control method, the function can be used in the following ways:
</p>
<p>1. Specify 'n.sample', 'effect.size', 'r.1' and 'alpha'. Calculates
'average power'
</p>
<p>2. Specify 'n.sample', 'effect.size', 'r.1', 'alpha' and 'lambda'. 
'N.tests' is also required. The function wil calculate the 'tp.power'
in addition to the 'average power'.
</p>
<p>3. Specify the 'average.power' or the pair 'tp.power' and 'lambda'. 
Specify all but one of the parameters, 'n.sample', 'effect.size', 'r.1' 
and 'alpha'. The function will calculate the value of the missing 
parameter required for the specified 'average power' or 'tp-power'. 
Note: a solution is guaranteed for missing 'n.sample' and missing
'effect.size', but not necessarily for missing 'r.1' or 'alpha'.
