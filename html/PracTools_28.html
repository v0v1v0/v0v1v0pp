<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A dataset of 343,398 persons based on the 2000 decennial U.S. Census for Anne Arundel County
in the US state of Maryland. Person records were generated based on counts from the 2000 census.
Individual values for each person were generated using models.
Groupings to form the variables <code>PSU</code> and <code>SSU</code> were done after sorting the census file by tract and block group within tract.
</p>
<p>Note that <code>MDarea.popA</code> is different from the dataset, <code>MDarea.pop</code>, that is used in the book by Valliant, Dever, and Kreuter (2018).  <code>MDarea.pop</code> is larger with 403,997 persons. <code>MDarea.popA</code> was created by taking an equal probability, systematic subsample from <code>MDarea.pop</code>. <code>MDarea.popA</code> does have the same numbers of <code>TRACT</code>s, <code>PSU</code>s, and <code>SSU</code>s as <code>MDarea.pop</code>. The smaller data set was created to meet the CRAN size limit on installed packages. The full population, <code>MDarea.pop</code>, can be downloaded from <code>https://umd.app.box.com/v/PracTools2ndEdition</code>.
