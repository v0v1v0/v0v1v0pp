<h2>Studies from the Many Labs 2 project.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A subset of the data collected in the Many Labs 2 project which conducted replications of 28 classic and contemporary findings in psychology.
The study examined the extent to which variability in replication success can be attributed to the study sample.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(manylabs2018)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A dataset with 1,414 rows and 23 variables.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>lab</code>: The lab which conducted the replication
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>es_id</code>: Unique id for each effect size
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>yi_r</code>: A numeric indicating  the observed effect size, expressed in r
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>vi_r</code>: A numeric indicating the variance on the observed effect size, expressed in r
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>yi_d</code>: A numeric indicating the observed effect size, expressed in Cohen's d
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>vi_d</code>: A numeric indicating the variance on the observed effect size, expressed in Cohen's d
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ni</code>: A numeric indicating the total sample size for the observed effect size
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>country</code>: Country where the sample was collected
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>weird</code>: Dummy variable encoding whether a country was classified as WEIRD; 0 = non-WEIRD, 1 = WEIRD
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>western</code>: Dummy variable encoding a team judgment whether country was considered "western"
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>educated</code>: Education score as measured by the Education Index
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>industrialized</code>: Industrialization score as measured in the 2016 Industrial Development Report
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>rich</code>: Dummy variable encoding whether a country is developed according to the 2014 World Economic Situation and Prospects Report; 0 = emerging or in transition, 1 = developed
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>democratic</code>: The quality democracy in the corresponding country according to the 2015 Democracy Ranking Report. Higher scores indicate higher quality.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>mean_weird_score</code>: The arithmetic mean of the <code>weird</code>, <code>western</code>, <code>educated</code>, <code>industrialized</code>, and <code>rich</code> variables
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>online</code>: Whether the study was replicated in a lab or online
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>analysis</code>: Unique id for replicated study
</p>
</li>
</ul>
