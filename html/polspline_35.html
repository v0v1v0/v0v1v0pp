<h2>Hare: hazard regression</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function summarizes both the stepwise selection process of the
model fitting by <code>hare</code>, as well as the final model
that was selected using AIC/BIC.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'hare'
summary(object, ...) 
## S3 method for class 'hare'
print(x, ...) </code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object,x</code></td>
<td>
 <p><code>hare</code> object, typically the result of <code>hare</code>.  </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>other arguments are ignored.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These function produce identical printed output. The main body consists of 
two tables. 
</p>
<p>The first table has six columns: the first column is a 
possible number of dimensions for the fitted model; 
</p>
<p>the second column indicates whether this model was fitted during 
the addition or deletion stage; 
</p>
<p>the third column is the log-likelihood for the fit; 
</p>
<p>the fourth column is <code>-2 * loglikelihood + penalty * (dimension)</code>, 
which is the AIC criterion - <code>hare</code> selected the model with 
the minimum value of AIC;  
</p>
<p>the last two columns give the 
endpoints of the interval of values of penalty that would yield the 
model with the indicated number of dimensions  
(<code>NA</code>s imply that the model is not optimal for any choice of penalty). 
</p>
<p>At the bottom of the first table the 
dimension of the selected model is reported, as is 
the value of penalty that was used. 
</p>
<p>Each row of the second table summarizes the information about  
a basis function in 
the final model. It shows the variables involved, the knot locations, the 
estimated coefficient and its standard error and Wald statistic (estimate/SE). 
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Since the basis functions are selected in an adaptive fashion, typically
most Wald statistics are larger than (the magical) 2. These statistics
should be taken with a grain of salt though, as they are inflated because
of the adaptivity of the model selection.</p>
