<h2>Peach brown rot pathogen *Monilinia fructicola*</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is microsatellite data for a population of the haploid 
plant pathogen *Monilinia fructicola* that causes disease within peach
tree canopies (Everhart &amp; Scherm, 2014). Entire populations within trees
were sampled across 3 years (2009, 2010, and 2011) in a total of four
trees, where one tree was sampled in all three years, for a total of 6
within-tree populations. Within each year, samples in the spring were taken
from affected blossoms (termed "BB" for blossom blight) and in late summer
from affected fruits (termed "FR" for fruit rot). There are a total of 694 
isolates with 65 to 173 isolates within each canopy population that were 
characterized using a set of 13 microsatellite markers.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(monpop)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>a [genclone-class] object with 3 hierarchical levels 
coded into one population factor. These are named "Tree", "Year", and 
"Symptom"
