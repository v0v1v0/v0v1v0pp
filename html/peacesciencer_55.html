<h2>Composition of Religious and Ethnic Groups (CREG) Fractionalization/Polarization Estimates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a data set with state-year estimates for ethnic and religious fractionalization/polarization,
by way of the Composition of Religious and Ethnic Groups (CREG) project at the
University of Illinois. I-L-L.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>data-raw</code> directory on the project's Github contains more information about how these data were
created. Pay careful attention to how I assigned CoW/G-W codes. The underlying data are version 1.02.
</p>
<p>The state codes provided by the CREG project are mostly Correlates of War codes, but with some differences.
Summarizing these differences: the state code for Serbia from 1992 to 2013 is actually the Gleditsch-Ward code (340).
Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union (1991-onward) is 393 and not 365. The Soviet Union has the 365 code.
Yugoslavia has the 345 code. The code for Yemen (678) is effectively the Gleditsch-Ward code because it spans the entire
post-World War II temporal domain. Likewise, the code for post-unification Germany is the Gleditsch-Ward code (260) as well.
The codebook actually says it's 265 (which would be East Germany's code), but this is assuredly a typo based on the data.
</p>
<p>The codebook cautions there are insufficient data for ethnic group estimates for Cameroon, France, India,
Kosovo, Montenegro, Mozambique, and Papua New Guinea. The French case is particularly disappointing but the
missing data there are a function of both France's constitution and modelling issues for CREG (per the
codebook). There are insufficient data to make religious group estimates for China, North Korea, and the
short-lived Republic of Vietnam.
</p>
<p>The fractionalization estimates are the familiar Herfindahl-Hirschman concentration index. The polarization
formula comes by way of Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2000), though this book does not appear to be published
beyond its placement online. I recommend Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2005) instead.
You can cite Alesina (2003) for the fractionalization measure if you'd like.
</p>
<p>In the most literal sense of "1", the group proportions may not sum to exactly 1 because of rounding in the
data. There were only two problem cases in these data worth mentioning. First, in both data sets, there would
be the occasional duplicates of group names by state-year (for example: Afghanistan in 1951 in the ethnic group
data and the United States in 1948 in the religious group data). In those cases, the script I make available
in the <code>data-raw</code> directory just select distinct values and that effectively fixes the problem of duplicates,
where they do appear. Finally, Costa Rica had a curious problem for most years in the religious group data. All
Costa Rica years have group data for Protestants, Roman Catholics, and "others." Up until 1964 or so, the "others"
are zero. Afterward, there is some small proportion of "others". However, the sum of Protestants, Roman Catholics, and
"others" exceeds 1 (pretty clearly) and the difference between the sum and 1 is entirely the "others." So, I drop
the "others" for all years. I don't think that's terribly problematic, but it's worth saying that's what I did.
