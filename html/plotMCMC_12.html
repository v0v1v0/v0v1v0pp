<h2>MCMC Results for Recruitment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Markov chain Monte Carlo results from stock assessment of cod
(<em>Gadus morhua</em>) in Icelandic waters, showing estimated
recruitment by year.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">xrec</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data frame containing 1000 rows and 33 columns (years 1970 to 2002).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each column contains the results of 1 million MCMC iterations, after
thinning to every 1000th iteration.
</p>
<p>The MCMC analysis started at the best fit, so no burn-in period was
discarded.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Recruitment is the size of a cohort (year class), in this case
thousands of one-year-olds.
</p>
<p>For example, <code>xrec$"1980"</code> is the estimated number of
one-year-olds in 1981, the cohort that hatched in 1980.
</p>
<p>This data frame is a subset of the <code>xmcmc</code> list
from the <span class="pkg">scape</span> package, which contains further documentation
about the data and model. More specifically, <code>xrec &lt;- xmcmc$R</code>.
</p>
<p>The MCMC analysis was run using the <dfn>AD Model Builder</dfn> software
(<a href="http://www.admb-project.org/">http://www.admb-project.org/</a>).
