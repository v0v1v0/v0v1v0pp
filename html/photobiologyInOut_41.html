<h2>Read multiple foreign files with spectral data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Read spectra from a homogeneous list of files based on a path and a list of
filenames or a path and a search pattern for files. The imported spectra are
returned as a single object of one of the collection of spectra classes from
package 'photobiology'.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">read_foreign2mspct(path = ".", list = NULL, pattern = NULL, .fun, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>character A path point to the location of the files.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>list</code></td>
<td>
<p>character A vector or list of character strings pointing to
files relative to <code>path</code>,</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pattern</code></td>
<td>
<p>character A search pattern to select files within <code>path</code>.
See <code>list.files</code> which is used internally. Argument ignored
is list is non-null.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>.fun</code></td>
<td>
<p>function One of the functions exported by this package for
reading spectral data.</p>

<p>Named arguments passed ot the call to <code>.fun</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function iterates over a list of file names reading them with
the function passed as argument to '.fun' and combines the spectra as a
collection of spectra of a class suitable for the spectral objects returned
by the argument to '.fun'. This function can either return for each file
read either a single spectrum as an object of class 'generic_spct' or a
class derived from it, or a collection of spectra of class 'generic_mspct'
or a class derived from it. The class of the returned object depends on
the class of the member spectra.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class 'generic_mspct' or a class derived from it, 
containing a collection of member spectra of class 'generic_spct' or of 
one of the classes derived from it.
