<h2>Requests an ACM certificate for use with other Amazon Web Services
services</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Requests an ACM certificate for use with other Amazon Web Services services. To request an ACM certificate, you must specify a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the <code>DomainName</code> parameter. You can also specify additional FQDNs in the <code>SubjectAlternativeNames</code> parameter.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/acm_request_certificate/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/acm_request_certificate/</a> for full documentation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">acm_request_certificate(
  DomainName,
  ValidationMethod = NULL,
  SubjectAlternativeNames = NULL,
  IdempotencyToken = NULL,
  DomainValidationOptions = NULL,
  Options = NULL,
  CertificateAuthorityArn = NULL,
  Tags = NULL,
  KeyAlgorithm = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>DomainName</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] Fully qualified domain name (FQDN), such as www.example.com, that you
want to secure with an ACM certificate. Use an asterisk (*) to create a
wildcard certificate that protects several sites in the same domain. For
example, *.example.com protects www.example.com, site.example.com, and
images.example.com.
</p>
<p>In compliance with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280">RFC 5280</a>, the length of the
domain name (technically, the Common Name) that you provide cannot
exceed 64 octets (characters), including periods. To add a longer domain
name, specify it in the Subject Alternative Name field, which supports
names up to 253 octets in length.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ValidationMethod</code></td>
<td>
<p>The method you want to use if you are requesting a public certificate to
validate that you own or control domain. You can <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/dns-validation.html">validate with DNS</a>
or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/email-validation.html">validate with email</a>.
We recommend that you use DNS validation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SubjectAlternativeNames</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional FQDNs to be included in the Subject Alternative Name
extension of the ACM certificate. For example, add the name
www.example.net to a certificate for which the <code>DomainName</code> field is
www.example.com if users can reach your site by using either name. The
maximum number of domain names that you can add to an ACM certificate is
100. However, the initial quota is 10 domain names. If you need more
than 10 names, you must request a quota increase. For more information,
see
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-limits.html">Quotas</a>.
</p>
<p>The maximum length of a SAN DNS name is 253 octets. The name is made up
of multiple labels separated by periods. No label can be longer than 63
octets. Consider the following examples:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠(63 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(61 octets)⁠</code> is legal because
the total length is 253 octets (63+1+63+1+63+1+61) and no label
exceeds 63 octets.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠(64 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(61 octets)⁠</code> is not legal
because the total length exceeds 253 octets (64+1+63+1+63+1+61) and
the first label exceeds 63 octets.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠(63 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(62 octets)⁠</code> is not legal
because the total length of the DNS name (63+1+63+1+63+1+62) exceeds
253 octets.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>IdempotencyToken</code></td>
<td>
<p>Customer chosen string that can be used to distinguish between calls to
<code>request_certificate</code>. Idempotency tokens
time out after one hour. Therefore, if you call
<code>request_certificate</code> multiple times with the
same idempotency token within one hour, ACM recognizes that you are
requesting only one certificate and will issue only one. If you change
the idempotency token for each call, ACM recognizes that you are
requesting multiple certificates.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>DomainValidationOptions</code></td>
<td>
<p>The domain name that you want ACM to use to send you emails so that you
can validate domain ownership.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Options</code></td>
<td>
<p>Currently, you can use this parameter to specify whether to add the
certificate to a certificate transparency log. Certificate transparency
makes it possible to detect SSL/TLS certificates that have been
mistakenly or maliciously issued. Certificates that have not been logged
typically produce an error message in a browser. For more information,
see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-bestpractices.html#best-practices-transparency">Opting Out of Certificate Transparency Logging</a>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>CertificateAuthorityArn</code></td>
<td>
<p>The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private certificate authority (CA)
that will be used to issue the certificate. If you do not provide an ARN
and you are trying to request a private certificate, ACM will attempt to
issue a public certificate. For more information about private CAs, see
the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaWelcome.html">Amazon Web Services Private Certificate Authority</a>
user guide. The ARN must have the following form:
</p>
<p><code>arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Tags</code></td>
<td>
<p>One or more resource tags to associate with the certificate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>KeyAlgorithm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies the algorithm of the public and private key pair that your
certificate uses to encrypt data. RSA is the default key algorithm for
ACM certificates. Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
keys are smaller, offering security comparable to RSA keys but with
greater computing efficiency. However, ECDSA is not supported by all
network clients. Some Amazon Web Services services may require RSA keys,
or only support ECDSA keys of a particular size, while others allow the
use of either RSA and ECDSA keys to ensure that compatibility is not
broken. Check the requirements for the Amazon Web Services service where
you plan to deploy your certificate. For more information about
selecting an algorithm, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-certificate.html#algorithms">Key algorithms</a>.
</p>
<p>Algorithms supported for an ACM certificate request include:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>RSA_2048</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>EC_prime256v1</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>EC_secp384r1</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other listed algorithms are for imported certificates only.
</p>
<p>When you request a private PKI certificate signed by a CA from Amazon
Web Services Private CA, the specified signing algorithm family (RSA or
ECDSA) must match the algorithm family of the CA's secret key.
</p>
<p>Default: RSA_2048</p>
