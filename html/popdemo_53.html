<h2>Polar bear matrices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Matrix projection model for the polar bear <em>Ursus maritimus</em>, with 
5 matrices corresponding to years 2001-2005. The matrices are based on a 
population in the southern Beaufort Sea. During 2001-2003, ice conditions were
classified as "good", but in 2004-2005, ice conditions were classified as 
"poor". Poor ice conditions lead to worse population performance. Stages are 
based on age and 
reproductive status:<br>
Stage-1: 2-year-old<br>
Stage 2: 3-year-old<br>
Stage 3: 4-year-old<br>
Stage 4: adult (5+ years old), available to breed<br>
Stage 5: adult, with cub (0-1 years old)<br>
Stage 6: adult, with yearling (1-2 years old).
