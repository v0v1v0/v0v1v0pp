<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The PCLasso2 model is a classification model that selects important
predictors at the protein complex level to achieve accurate classification
and identify risk protein complexes. The PCLasso2 model has three inputs: a
protein expression matrix, a vector of binary response variables, and a
number of known protein complexes. It estimates the correlation between
protein expression and response variable at the level of protein complexes.
Similar to traditional Lasso-logistic model, PCLasso2 is based on the
logistic regression model and estimates the logistic regression coefficients
by maximizing likelihood function with regularization penalty. The
difference is that PCLasso2 selects features at the level of protein
complexes rather than individual proteins. Considering that proteins usually
function by forming protein complexes, PCLasso2 regards proteins belonging
to the same protein complex as a group and constructs a group Lasso penalty
(l1/l2 penalty) based on the sum (i.e. l1 norm) of the l2 norms of the
regression coefficients of the group members to perform the selection of
features at the group level. With the group Lasso penalty, PCLasso2 trains
the logistic regression model and obtains a sparse solution at the protein
complex level, that is, the proteins belonging to a protein complex are
either wholly included or wholly excluded from the model. PCLasso2 outputs a
prediction model and a small set of protein complexes included in the model,
which are referred to as risk protein complexes. The PCSCAD and PCMCP are
performed by setting the penalty parameter <code>penalty</code> as <code>grSCAD</code>
and <code>grMCP</code>, respectively.
