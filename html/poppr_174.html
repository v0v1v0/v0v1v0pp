<h2>Calculate random samples of the index of association for genlight objects.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Genlight objects can contain millions of loci. Since it does not make much 
sense to calculate the index of association over that many loci, this
function will randomly sample sites to calculate the index of association.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">samp.ia(x, n.snp = 100L, reps = 100L, threads = 1L, quiet = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a [genlight][genlight-class] or [snpclone][snpclone-class] object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n.snp</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of snps to be used to calculate standardized index
of association.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reps</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of times to perform the calculation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threads</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum number of parallel threads to be used within this 
function. A value of 0 (default) will attempt to use as many threads as
there are available cores/CPUs. In most cases this is ideal. A value of 1
will force the function to run serially, which may increase stability on
some systems. Other values may be specified, but should be used with
caution.</p>

<p>if 'FALSE', a progress bar will be printed to the screen.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The index of association is a summary of linkage disequilibrium 
among many loci. More information on the index of association can be found 
associated with the funciton [ia()]. A value near or at zero
indicator of linkage equilibrium, whereas values significantly greater than
zero indicate linkage disequilibrium. However, if the observed variance in 
distance among individuals is less than the expected, mildly negative 
values may be observed (as the range of this index is negative one to one).
This function will call the function [bitwise.ia()] for
'reps' times to calculate the index of association over 'n.snp'
loci. The standardized index of association ('rbarD') will be calculated
'reps' times. These esitmates of linkage disequilibrium from random
genomic fractions can then be summarized (e.g., using a histogram) as an
estimate of genome-wide linkage disequilibrium.
</p>
<p>This function currently only works for objects of class genlight or snpclone
that are of a single ploidy level and that ploidy is either haploid or
diploid.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Index of association representing the samples in this genlight
object.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>this will calculate the standardized index of association from Agapow
2001. See [ia()] for details.
