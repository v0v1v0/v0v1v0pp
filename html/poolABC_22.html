<h2>Compute the fraction of sites fixed between populations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function will compute the fraction of sites that constitute a fixed
difference between populations.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fixed(minor, total, nPops)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>minor</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a matrix with the number of minor-allele reads. Each row of
the matrix is a different population and each column a different site.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>total</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a matrix with the total coverage. Each row of the matrix is a
different population and each column a different site.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nPops</code></td>
<td>
<p>is an integer indicating the total number of populations.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>More precisely, we define fixed differences as sites where the number of
minor-allele reads of a given population is equal to the total coverage of
that population and equal to zero in the other population.
</p>
<p>For models with two populations, this function compares the two present-day
populations. For models with four populations, this function performs a
pairwise comparison of the populations at each of the locations. For the
models with four populations, we also assess the fraction of sites that
represent a fixed difference between any of the populations and the remaining
three populations.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a numeric vector with a single entry when <code>nPops</code> is equal to 2 or
with three entries when <code>nPops</code> is set to 4.
