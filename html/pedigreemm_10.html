<p>Records of the number of cases of clinical mastitis during the first
lactation of 1,675 cows, primarily Holsteins.
Cows belonged to 41 herds and were daughters of 38 sires. 
There were 1,491 healthy cows, 134 had only one case of mastitis, 
36 had 2 cases, and 14 had between 4 and  cases. 
Overall, mastitis incidence was 0.11. 
Calving years for these records were from 2000 through 2005. 
The sire, herd and days in milk are also recorded for each
cow.
