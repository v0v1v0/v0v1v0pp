<h2>Estimated ROC curves</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Plot of ROC curves estimated under parametric model assumptions
on the continuous diagnostic marker.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ROC.plot(ydat, xdat, distr = "exp", method = "RPstar", mc = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ydat</code></td>
<td>

<p>data vector of the diagnostic marker measurements on the sample of non-diseased individuals (from Y).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xdat</code></td>
<td>

<p>data vector of the diagnostic marker measurements on the sample of diseased individuals (from X).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>distr</code></td>
<td>

<p>character string specifying the type of distribution assumed for Y and X. Possible choices for <code>distr</code> are "exp" (default)
for the one-parameter exponential, "norm_EV" and "norm_DV" for the Gaussian distribution with,
respectively, equal or unequal variances assumed for the two random variables. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>

<p>character string specifying the methodological approach used for estimating the
probability R, which is here interpreted as the area under the ROC curve (AUC). 
The argument <code>method</code> can be set equal to "Wald", "RP" or RPstar" (default), according as inference 
is based on the Wald statistic, the signed log-likelihood ratio statistic (directed likelihhod, <code class="reqn">r_p</code>) or
the modified signed log-likelihood ratio statistic (modified directed likelihood, <code class="reqn">r_p^*</code>), respectively.
For estimating the ROC curve parametrically, methods "Wald" and "RP" are equivalent and supply
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), whereas, by using method "RPstar", estimate of the ROC
curve is based on the modified signed log-likelihood ratio statistic (<code class="reqn">r_p^*</code>).
See <code>rpstar</code> for details on this statistic.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mc</code></td>
<td>

<p>a numeric value indicating single or multiple plots in the same figure.
In case <code>mc</code> is equal to 1 (default), only the method specified in <code>method</code>
is applied and the corresponding estimated ROC curve is plotted. If <code>mc</code> 
is different from 1, both MLE and <code class="reqn">r_p^*</code>-based methods are applied, and two differently
estimated ROC curves are plotted.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If <code>mc</code> is different from 1, <code>method</code> does not need to be specified.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Plot of ROC curves
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The two independent random variables Y and X with given distribution
<code>distr</code> are measurements of the diagnostic marker on the diseased
and non-diseased subjects, respectively.<br>
In "Wald" method, or equivalently "RP" method,  MLEs for parameters of the Y and X distributions
are computed and then used to estimate specificity and sensitivity.
These measures are evaluated as <code class="reqn">P(Y&lt;t)</code> and <code class="reqn">P(X&gt;t)</code>, respectively.<br>
In "RPstar" method, parameters of the Y and X distributions are estimated 
from the <code class="reqn">r_p^*</code>-based estimate of the AUC.
