<h2>Write board manifest file to board's root directory</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A board manifest file records all the pins, along with their
versions, stored on a board.
This can be useful for a board built using, for example,
<code>board_folder()</code> or <code>board_s3()</code>, then served as a website,
such that others can consume using <code>board_url()</code>.
The manifest file is <em>not</em> versioned like a pin is, and this function
will overwrite any existing <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠_pins.yaml⁠</code> file on your board. It is
your responsibility as the user to keep the manifest up to date.
</p>
<p>Some examples are provided in <code>vignette("using-board-url")</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">write_board_manifest(board, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>board</code></td>
<td>
<p>A pin board that is <em>not</em> read-only.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional arguments passed on to methods for a specific board.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is not supported for read-only boards.
It is called for the side-effect of writing a manifest file,
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠_pins.yaml⁠</code>, to the root directory of the  <code>board</code>. (This will
not work in the unlikely event that you attempt to create a pin
called <code>"_pins.yaml"</code>.)
</p>
<p>The behavior of the legacy API (for example, <code>pin_find()</code>) is unspecified
once you have written a board manifest file to a board's root directory.
We recommend you only use <code>write_board_manifest()</code> with modern boards.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The board, invisibly
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">board &lt;- board_temp()
pin_write(board, mtcars, "mtcars-csv", type = "csv")
pin_write(board, mtcars, "mtcars-json", type = "json")

write_board_manifest(board)

# see the manifest's format:
fs::path(board$path, "_pins.yaml") %&gt;% readLines() %&gt;% cat(sep = "\n")

# if you write another pin, the manifest file is out of date:
pin_write(board, 1:10, "nice-numbers", type = "json")

# you decide when to update the manifest:
write_board_manifest(board)

</code></pre>
