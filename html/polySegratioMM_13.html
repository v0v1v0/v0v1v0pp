<h2>Results of MCMC estimation for simulated overdispersed markers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> MCMC was performed using the wrapper function
<code>runSegratioMM</code> to
run JAGS for a Bayesian mixture model on the segregation ratios
obtained using the simulated data <code>hexmarkers.overdisp</code>. These
data were simulated as 500 markers for 200 “auto–hexaploid
individuals” exhibiting overdispersion with shape1=25. The underlying
percentages of single double and triple dose markers are 70%, 20% and
10%, respectively.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of S3 class <code>runJagsWrapper</code> with various
components including summaries and diagnostics.</p>
