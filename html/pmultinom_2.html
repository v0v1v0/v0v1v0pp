<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The calculation follows the scheme suggested in Levin (1981): begin with the
equivalent probability for a Poisson random vector, and update it by
conditioning on the sum of the vector being equal to the size parameter,
using Bayes' theorem. This requires computation of the distribution of a sum
of truncated Poisson random variables, which is accomplished using
convolution, as per Levin's suggestion for an exact calculation. Levin's
suggestion for an approximate calculation, using Edgeworth expansions, may be
added to a later version. Fast convolution is achieved using the fastest
Fourier transform in the west (Frigo, Johnson 1998).

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The probability that a multinomial random vector is greater than all
the lower bounds, and less than or equal all the upper bounds:
</p>
<p>P(l1 &lt; N1 &lt;= u1, ..., lk &lt; Nk &lt;= uk)
</p>
<p>If only the upper bounds are given, then this is the multinomial CDF:
</p>
<p>P(N1&lt;=u1, ..., Nk&lt;=uk)
</p>
<p>If only the upper bounds are given, then this is the multinomial tail probability:
</p>
<p>P(N1&gt;l1, ..., Nk&gt;lk)
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># To determine the bias of a die, Rudolph Wolf rolled it
# 20,000 times. Side 2 was the most frequently observed, and
# was observed 3631 times. What is the probability that a
# fair die would have a side observed this many times or
# more?

# Input: 
1 - pmultinom(upper=rep.int(3630, 6), size=20000,
              probs=rep.int(1/6, 6), method="exact")
# Output:
# [1] 7.379909e-08

# Therefore we conclude that the die is biased. Fougere
# (1988) attempted to account for these biases by assuming
# certain manufacturing errors. Repeating the calculation
# with the distribution Fougere derived:

# Input:
theoretical.dist &lt;- c(.17649, .17542, .15276, .15184, .17227, .17122)
1 - pmultinom(upper=rep.int(3630, 6), size=20000,
              probs=theoretical.dist, method="exact")
# Output:
# [1] 0.043362

# Therefore we conclude that the die still seems more biased
# than Fougere's model can explain.
