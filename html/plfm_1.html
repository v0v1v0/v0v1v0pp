<h2>Probabilistic Latent Feature Analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions for estimating disjunctive, conjunctive or additive probabilistic latent feature models on (aggregated) binary three-way data
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Probabilistic latent feature models can be used to model three-way three-mode binary observations (e.g. persons who indicate for each of a number of products and for each of 
a set of attributes whether a product has a certain attribute). A basic probabilistic feature model (referred to as <code>plfm</code>) uses aggregated three-way three-mode binary 
data as input, namely the two-way two-mode frequency table that is obtained by summing the binary three-way three-mode data across persons. The basic probabilistic feature model 
(Maris, De Boeck and Van Mechelen, 1996) is based
on the assumption that observations are statistically independent and that model parameters are homogeneous across persons. The <code>plfm</code> function can be used to locate 
the posterior mode(s) of basic probabilistic feature models, and to compute information criteria for model selection, and measures of statistical and descriptive model fit. 
The <code>stepplfm</code> function can be used to fit a series of disjunctive, conjunctive or additive basic probabilistic feature models with different number of latent features. 
In addition, the <code>bayesplfm</code> function can be used to compute a sample of the posterior distribution of the basic probabilistic feature model 
in the neigbourhood of a specific posterior mode.
</p>
<p>Latent class extensions of the probabilistic feature model (referred to as <code>LCplfm</code>) take binary three-way three-mode observations as input. In contrast to the basic probabilistic 
feature model, latent class probabilistic feature models allow to model dependencies between (subsets of) observations (Meulders, De Boeck and Van Mechelen, 2003) 
and/or to account for heterogeneity in model parameters across persons (Meulders, Tuerlinckx, and Vanpaemel, 2013).
The <code>LCplfm</code> function can be used to compute posterior mode estimates (of different types of) latent class probabilistic 
feature models as well as to compute information criteria for model selection, and measures of descriptive model fit. The <code>stepLCplfm</code> function can be used to compute a series of
latent class probabilistic feature models with different numbers of latent features and latent classes.
