<h2>Removed functions in PowerTOST</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Details about removed functions in PowerTOST.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>type1error.2TOST</code> was designed to calculate the type I error (<em>TIE</em>) rate of two simultaneous TOST procedures with some specified correlation of the parameters. It suffered from poor precision to obtain the <em>TIE</em> via simulations.<br>
Due to the intersection-union principle the <em>TIE</em> is always upper bounded to <em>α</em> by theory and hence, <code>type1error.2TOST</code> was removed in version 1.4-7.
</p>
<p><code>power.scABEL2</code> and <code>sampleN.scABEL2</code> were deprecated in version 1.4-1. In <code>power.scABEL</code> and <code>sampleN.scABEL</code> the regulator component <code>"est_method"</code> is used for switching between simulations based on the EMA’s ANOVA evaluation or ISC evaluation, respectively.<br><code>power.scABEL2</code> and <code>sampleN.scABEL2</code> were removed in version 1.4-3.
</p>
<p><code>power2.TOST</code> was deprecated in version 1.2-6 since <code>power.TOST</code> was modified in order to handle unbalanced sequences. <code>power2.TOST</code> was removed in version in version 1.2-7.
</p>
<p>The functions <code>power.NTIDFDA</code>, <code>sampleN.NTIDFDA</code> and <code>pa.NTIDFDA</code> were deprecated in 
version 1.5-4 and were removed in version 1.5-6.
