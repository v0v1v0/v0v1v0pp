<h2>The CreateHITType operation creates a new HIT type</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>create_hit_type</code> operation creates a new HIT type. This operation allows you to define a standard set of HIT properties to use when creating HITs. If you register a HIT type with values that match an existing HIT type, the HIT type ID of the existing type will be returned.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/mturk_create_hit_type/">https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/mturk_create_hit_type/</a> for full documentation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mturk_create_hit_type(
  AutoApprovalDelayInSeconds = NULL,
  AssignmentDurationInSeconds,
  Reward,
  Title,
  Keywords = NULL,
  Description,
  QualificationRequirements = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>AutoApprovalDelayInSeconds</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of seconds after an assignment for the HIT has been
submitted, after which the assignment is considered Approved
automatically unless the Requester explicitly rejects it.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>AssignmentDurationInSeconds</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The amount of time, in seconds, that a Worker has to complete the HIT
after accepting it. If a Worker does not complete the assignment within
the specified duration, the assignment is considered abandoned. If the
HIT is still active (that is, its lifetime has not elapsed), the
assignment becomes available for other users to find and accept.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Reward</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The amount of money the Requester will pay a Worker for successfully
completing the HIT.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Title</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] The title of the HIT. A title should be short and descriptive about the
kind of task the HIT contains. On the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site,
the HIT title appears in search results, and everywhere the HIT is
mentioned.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Keywords</code></td>
<td>
<p>One or more words or phrases that describe the HIT, separated by commas.
These words are used in searches to find HITs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Description</code></td>
<td>
<p>[required] A general description of the HIT. A description includes detailed
information about the kind of task the HIT contains. On the Amazon
Mechanical Turk web site, the HIT description appears in the expanded
view of search results, and in the HIT and assignment screens. A good
description gives the user enough information to evaluate the HIT before
accepting it.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>QualificationRequirements</code></td>
<td>
<p>Conditions that a Worker's Qualifications must meet in order to accept
the HIT. A HIT can have between zero and ten Qualification requirements.
All requirements must be met in order for a Worker to accept the HIT.
Additionally, other actions can be restricted using the <code>ActionsGuarded</code>
field on each <code>QualificationRequirement</code> structure.</p>
