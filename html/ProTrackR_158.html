<h2>The PTPattern class</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>PTPattern</code> (or simply pattern) is a table that determines which
samples are played at which notes in which octave, in which order and with
which effects.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When a <code>PTPattern</code> table (or simply pattern) is played, each of the 64
rows (see the green mark in the illustration below for an example of a row)
are played subsequently at a specified speed/tempo.
</p>
<p>Note that ProTracker uses row indices that start at zero. However, this package
uses indices starting at one, conform R language definitions.
</p>

<p>The table has four columns (see the purple outline in the illustration
above as an example of a column), representing the four audio channels (<code>PTTrack</code>)
of the Commodore Amiga. Samples listed in the same row at different
tracks will be played simultaneously.
</p>
<p>An element at a specific row and track will be referred to as a <code>PTCell</code>
(or simply cell). The cell determines which sample needs to be played at
which note and octave and what kind of <code>effect</code> or trigger should
be applied.
</p>
<p>With the <code>PTPattern-method</code>, objects can be coerced to a pattern
table. This method can also be used to extract or replace patterns in
<code>PTModule</code> objects.
</p>


<h3>Slots</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>data</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A <code>matrix</code> (64 rows, 16 columns) of class <code>raw</code>.
Each row contains the <code>raw</code> concatenated data of 4 <code>PTCell</code> objects,
representing each of the 4 audio channels/tracks (as each <code>PTCell</code> object holds
4 <code>raw</code> values, each row holds 4 x 4 = 16 <code>raw</code>
values). The <code>raw</code> data is formatted conform the specifications given
in the <code>PTCell</code> documentation.</p>
