<h2>partR2: Partitioning R2 in generalized linear mixed models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The partR2 package provides a simple way to estimate R2 in mixed models fitted with lme4
as well as part (semi-partial) R2 for specific predictors and combinations of predictors,
among other several other statistics. Here is an overview:
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> Marginal and conditional R2 for LMMs and GLMMs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Part (semi-partial) R2 which estimate the explained variance for
specific predictors and combinations of predictors.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Structure coefficients (SC). SC are the correlation between a
predictor and the predicted response (called the linear predictor), independent of the other predictors.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Inclusive R2 (IR2), which estimate the the total variance explained by a predictor independent of
other predictors. IR2 is estimated with SC^2 * R2_full_model.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Beta weights, which are standardised regression coefficients.
If beta is a model estimate for variable x, and y is the response,then the
beta weight is beta * (sd(x)/sd(y).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Confidence intervals for all estimates using parametric bootstrapping.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The package has one main function <code>partR2</code> which takes a fitted model
from lme4. At the moment, Gaussian, Poisson and binomial models are supported.
For Poisson and non-binary binomial models, <code>partR2</code> adds an
observational level random effect to model additive overdispersion (if
an olre is not fitted already).
</p>
<p>The <code>summary.partR2</code> function provides an extended summary with R2s, semi-partial
R2s, model estimates and structure coefficients. The <code>forestplot</code>
function provides a means of plotting the results.
