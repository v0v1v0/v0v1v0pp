<h2>Create a pim.poset environment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows you to create a <code>pim.poset</code> environment 
that can be added to a <code>pim.environment</code> object. You can
use this function to create a custom poset, but in general it's safer
to use the relevant arguments of the <code>pim</code> function. 
That way more safety checks are carried out.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">new.pim.poset(compare, nobs, parent = parent.frame(), ...)

## S4 method for signature 'character,numeric'
new.pim.poset(compare, nobs, parent = parent.frame(), ...)

## S4 method for signature 'matrix,numeric'
new.pim.poset(compare, nobs, parent = parent.frame(), ...)

## S4 method for signature 'list,numeric'
new.pim.poset(compare, nobs, parent, comp.value = "custom", ...)

## S4 method for signature 'matrix,missing'
new.pim.poset(compare, nobs, parent = parent.frame(), ...)

## S4 method for signature 'list,missing'
new.pim.poset(compare, nobs, parent = parent.frame(), ...)

## S4 method for signature 'missing,numeric'
new.pim.poset(compare, nobs, parent = parent.frame(), ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>compare</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character value, matrix or list indicating how the
poset should be constructed. Defaults to the default value of 
<code>create.poset</code>. See Details section for more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nobs</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer value determining the number of observations
this poset is created for. If compare is not a character value,
the number of observations</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parent</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional environment that serves as the parent for the
<code>pim.poset</code> environment. By default this is the environment
from which the function is called. Note that for a correct functioning,
the parent environment should be set to the <code>pim.environment</code>
this object is part of. This is done automatically by the function
<code>add.poset</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>arguments passed to other methods.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>comp.value</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character value to be used as value for the 
compare slot of the object. Defaults to 'custom' and 
should be left at the default without
a very good reason to change it.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A poset (or pseudo observation set) in the context of 
probabilistic index models is a set of indices that determines
which observations are compared with one another. It is used to
construct the pseudo-observations on which the model is fitted.
You can think of a poset as a "pseudo-observation set".
</p>
<p>The most convenient way to use this function, is by specifying
a character value for the argument <code>compare</code>. The value "unique"
creates a poset in such a way that only unique combinations of two
observations are used in the model. The value "all" creates all
possible L-R combinations between the observations.
</p>
<p>If you want to define the poset yourself, you can pass either a matrix 
or a list with 2 elements as value for the argument <code>compare</code>.
Columns of the matrix or elements of the list should either be named
"L" and "R", or be unnamed. When unnamed, the function takes the first
column/element as the left poset, and the second column/element as
the right poset. If the (col)names are anything else but "L" and "R",
these names are ignored and the first column is seen as "L".
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an <code>pim.poset</code> object that can be used to
replace the poset in a pim environment.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>You can omit the argument <code>compare</code> if you supply a value for
<code>nobs</code>. You can also omit the argument <code>nobs</code> if you
provide a matrix or list as value for <code>compare</code>. The function
will try to deduct the number of observations from the highest 
index value present in the matrix/list
</p>
<p>You can't omit both arguments together though, as the function
needs at least some information on the number of observations
the poset is designed for.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Changing the value of <code>comp.value</code> by hand might result in 
errors or a wrongly fitted model. The argument exists for internal
purposes and possible extensions later on, but should not be used.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>add.poset</code> for more information on how to
adapt the poset of a <code>pim.environment</code> object.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mypos &lt;- new.pim.poset('unique',n=10) # creates empty environment
ls(mypos)
# Using the created poset functions L and R
# Note this is purely as illustration, this makes no sense
# in the context of a pim analysis.
mypos$L(1:10)
mypos$R(1:10)
