<h2>Simulate Pool-seq data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulates pooled sequencing data given a set of parameters and individual
genotypes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">simPoolseq(
  genotypes,
  pools,
  pError,
  sError,
  mCov,
  vCov,
  min.minor,
  minimum = NA,
  maximum = NA
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>genotypes</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of genotypes, where each entry is a matrix
corresponding to a different locus. At each matrix, each column is a
different SNP and each row is a different individual. Genotypes should be
coded as 0, 1 or 2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pools</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list with a vector containing the size (in number of diploid
individuals) of each pool. Thus, if a population was sequenced using a
single pool, the vector should contain only one entry. If a population was
sequenced using two pools, each with 10 individuals, this vector should
contain two entries and both will be 10.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pError</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer representing the value of the error associated with
DNA pooling. This value is related with the unequal contribution of both
individuals and pools towards the total number of reads observed for a
given population - the higher the value the more unequal are the individual
and pool contributions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sError</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric value with error rate associated with the sequencing
and mapping process. This error rate is assumed to be symmetric:
error(reference -&gt; alternative) = error(alternative -&gt; reference). This
number should be between 0 and 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mCov</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer that defines the mean depth of coverage to simulate.
Please note that this represents the mean coverage across all sites.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vCov</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer that defines the mean depth of coverage to simulate.
Please note that this represents the mean coverage across all sites.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min.minor</code></td>
<td>
<p>is an integer representing the minimum allowed number of
minor-allele reads. Sites that, across all populations, have less
minor-allele reads than this threshold will be removed from the data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>minimum</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional integer representing the minimum coverage allowed.
Sites where the population has a depth of coverage below this threshold are
removed from the data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maximum</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional integer representing the maximum coverage allowed.
Sites where the population has a depth of coverage above this threshold are
removed from the data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note that this functions allows for different combinations of parameters.
Thus, Pool-seq data can be simulated for a variety of parameters. For
instance, different mean depths of coverage can be used to simulate Pool-seq
data. It is also possible to simulate Pool-seq data using different pool
sizes (by changing the <code>pools</code> input) and different values of the
Pool-seq error parameter (<code>pError</code>).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list with three named entries:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reference</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list with one entry per locus. Each entry is a matrix with
the number of reference allele reads. Each column represents a different site.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alternative</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list with one entry per locus. Each entry is a matrix with
the number of alternative allele reads. Each column represents a different site.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>total</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list with one entry per locus. Each entry is a matrix with
the total depth of coverage. Each column represents a different site.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># simulate Pool-seq data for 100 individuals sampled at a single locus
genotypes &lt;- run_scrm(nDip = 100, nloci = 1, theta = 5)
# simulate Pool-seq data assuming a coverage of 100x and two pools of 50 individuals each
simPoolseq(genotypes = genotypes, pools = c(50, 50), pError = 100, sError = 0.001,
mCov = 100, vCov = 250, min.minor = 0)

# simulate Pool-seq data for 10 individuals sampled at 5 loci
genotypes &lt;- run_scrm(nDip = 10, nloci = 5, theta = 5)
# simulate Pool-seq data assuming a coverage of 100x and a single pool of 10 individuals
simPoolseq(genotypes = genotypes, pools = 10, pError = 100, sError = 0.001,
mCov = 100, vCov = 250, min.minor = 0)
