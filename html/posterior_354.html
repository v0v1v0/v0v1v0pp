<h2>Weight <code>draws</code> objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Add weights to <code>draws</code> objects, with one weight per draw, for use in
subsequent weighting operations. For reasons of numerical accuracy, weights
are stored in the form of unnormalized log-weights (in a variable called
<code>.log_weight</code>). See <code>weights.draws()</code> for details how to extract weights from
<code>draws</code> objects.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">weight_draws(x, weights, ...)

## S3 method for class 'draws_matrix'
weight_draws(x, weights, log = FALSE, pareto_smooth = FALSE, ...)

## S3 method for class 'draws_array'
weight_draws(x, weights, log = FALSE, pareto_smooth = FALSE, ...)

## S3 method for class 'draws_df'
weight_draws(x, weights, log = FALSE, pareto_smooth = FALSE, ...)

## S3 method for class 'draws_list'
weight_draws(x, weights, log = FALSE, pareto_smooth = FALSE, ...)

## S3 method for class 'draws_rvars'
weight_draws(x, weights, log = FALSE, pareto_smooth = FALSE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>(draws) A <code>draws</code> object or another <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> object for which the method
is defined.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>(numeric vector) A vector of weights of length <code>ndraws(x)</code>.
Weights will be internally stored on the log scale (in a variable called
<code>.log_weight</code>) and will not be normalized, but normalized (non-log) weights
can be returned via the <code>weights.draws()</code> method later.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Arguments passed to individual methods (if applicable).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>log</code></td>
<td>
<p>(logical) Are the weights passed already on the log scale? The
default is <code>FALSE</code>, that is, expecting <code>weights</code> to be on the standard
(non-log) scale.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pareto_smooth</code></td>
<td>
<p>(logical) Should the weights be Pareto-smoothed?
The default is <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>draws</code> object of the same class as <code>x</code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">x &lt;- example_draws()

# sample some random weights for illustration
wts &lt;- rexp(ndraws(x))
head(wts)

# add weights
x &lt;- weight_draws(x, weights = wts)

# extract weights
head(weights(x)) # defaults to normalized weights
head(weights(x, normalize=FALSE)) # recover original weights
head(weights(x, log=TRUE)) # get normalized log-weights

# add weights which are already on the log scale
log_wts &lt;- log(wts)
head(log_wts)

x &lt;- weight_draws(x, weights = log_wts, log = TRUE)
# extract weights
head(weights(x))
head(weights(x, log=TRUE, normalize = FALSE)) # recover original log_wts

# add weights on log scale and Pareto smooth them
x &lt;- weight_draws(x, weights = log_wts, log = TRUE, pareto_smooth = TRUE)
