<h2>projects: A project infrastructure for researchers.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>projects</code> package provides a project infrastructure with a focus on
manuscript creation. It creates a project folder with a single command,
containing subdirectories for specific components, templates for manuscripts,
and so on.
</p>


<h3>Knitting</h3>

<p>There are several functions that require interactive user
confirmation via the console. Since interactive console input is
incompatible with knitting via R Markdown files, the <code>projects</code>
package was coded such that user confirmation is bypassed when
<code>isTRUE(getOption('knitr.in.progress')) == TRUE</code>. Therefore, all
<code>projects</code> package functions are usable when knitting. <strong>Knit
with caution!</strong>
