<h2>Periodic time series objects for examples</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Periodic time series objects for examples and tests. These objects are
from classes defined in package “pcts” and as a consequence are
not suitable for access with <code>data()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pcts_exdata(x, envir = parent.frame())
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>a character vector giving the names of objects. If missing, all
available objects will be created. Can also be <code>NA</code>. In that
case no objects are created and the names of all available objects
are returned.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>envir</code></td>
<td>

<p>environment where the objects are put, the default is the
environment of the caller.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The requested objects are created and put in <code>envir</code>.  Its
default is the environment of the caller, which should be sufficient
in most use cases.
</p>
<p>The following objects are currently available:
<code>ap</code>, <code>ap7to9</code>, <code>pcfr</code>, <code>pcfr2to4</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>if <code>x</code> is <code>NA</code>, the names of the available objects.
Otherwise the function is called for the side effect of creating
objects in <code>envir</code> and the return value (the names of the created
objects) is usually discarded.
