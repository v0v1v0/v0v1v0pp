<h2>Fetch evidence &amp; conclusion ontology</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fetches all evidence &amp; conclusion ontology (ECO) information from the QuickGO EBI database. The ECO project is
maintained through a public <a href="https://github.com/evidenceontology/evidenceontology">GitHub repository</a>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fetch_eco(
  return_relation = FALSE,
  return_history = FALSE,
  show_progress = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>return_relation</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical value that indicates if relational information should be returned instead
the main descriptive information. This data can be used to check the relations of ECO terms to each other.
Default is FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>return_history</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical value that indicates if the entry history of an ECO term should be
returned instead the main descriptive information.
Default is FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>show_progress</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical value that indicates if a progress bar will be shown.
Default is TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>According to the GitHub repository ECO is defined as follows:
</p>
<p>"The Evidence &amp; Conclusion Ontology (ECO) describes types of scientific evidence within the
biological research domain that arise from laboratory experiments, computational methods,
literature curation, or other means. Researchers use evidence to support conclusions
that arise out of scientific research. Documenting evidence during scientific research
is essential, because evidence gives us a sense of why we believe what we think we know.
Conclusions are asserted as statements about things that are believed to be true, for
example that a protein has a particular function (i.e. a protein functional annotation) or
that a disease is associated with a particular gene variant (i.e. a phenotype-gene association).
A systematic and structured (i.e. ontological) classification of evidence allows us to store,
retreive, share, and compare data associated with that evidence using computers, which are
essential to navigating the ever-growing (in size and complexity) corpus of scientific
information."

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame that contains descriptive information about each ECO term in the EBI database.
If either <code>return_relation</code> or <code>return_history</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>, the respective information is
returned instead of the usual output.
