<h2>You can retry a stage that has failed without having to run a pipeline
again from the beginning</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>You can retry a stage that has failed without having to run a pipeline again from the beginning. You do this by either retrying the failed actions in a stage or by retrying all actions in the stage starting from the first action in the stage. When you retry the failed actions in a stage, all actions that are still in progress continue working, and failed actions are triggered again. When you retry a failed stage from the first action in the stage, the stage cannot have any actions in progress. Before a stage can be retried, it must either have all actions failed or some actions failed and some succeeded.
