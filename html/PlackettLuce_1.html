<h2>Plackett-Luce Models for Rankings</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Plackett-Luce provides functions to prepare rankings data in order to fit
the Plackett-Luce model or Plackett-Luce trees. The implementation can handle
ties, sub-rankings and rankings that imply disconnected or weakly connected
preference networks. Methods are provided for summary and inference.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The main function in the package is the model-fitting function
<code>PlackettLuce</code> and the help file for that function provides
details of the Plackett-Luce model, which is extended here to accommodate
ties.
</p>
<p>Rankings data must be passed to <code>PlackettLuce</code> in a specific form, see
<code>rankings</code> for more details. Other functions for handling
rankings include <code>choices</code> to express the rankings as
choices from alternatives; <code>adjacency</code> to create an adjacency matrix of
wins and losses implied by the rankings and <code>connectivity</code> to check the
connectivity of the underlying preference network.
</p>
<p>Several methods are available to inspect fitted Plackett-Luce models, help
files are available for less common methods or where arguments may be
specified: <code>coef</code>, <code>deviance</code>, <code>fitted</code>,
<code>itempar</code>, <code>logLik</code>, <code>print</code>,
<code>qvcalc</code>, <code>summary</code>, <code>vcov</code>.
</p>
<p>PlackettLuce also provides the function <code>pltree</code> to fit a Plackett-Luce
tree i.e. a tree that partitions the rankings by covariate values,
identifying subgroups with different sets of worth parameters for the items.
In this case <code>group</code> must be used to prepare the data.
</p>
<p>Several data sets are provided in the package: <code>beans</code>,
<code>nascar</code>, <code>pudding</code>. The help files for these give
further illustration of preparing rankings data for modelling. The
<code>read.soc</code> function enables further example data sets of
"Strict Orders - Complete List" format (i.e. complete rankings with no ties)
to be downloaded from <a href="https://www.preflib.org/">PrefLib</a>.
</p>
<p>A full explanation of the methods with illustrations using the package data
sets is given in the vignette,
<code>vignette("Overview", package = "PlackettLuce")</code>.
