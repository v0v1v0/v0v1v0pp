<h2>show marker and haplotype dosages for one FS family</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>show marker and haplotype dosages for one FS family and its
parents
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">showOneFS(FSnr, hbresults, mrkDosage, FS, parents)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>FSnr</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of the FS family (indexes the FS list and parents)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hbresults</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list with the haplotyping results for one haploblock:
one element of a list as returned by inferHaplotypes</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mrkDosage</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix of marker dosages, may contain rows for more
markers than only those in the current haploblock (the relevant markers are
specified in the hbresults list)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>FS</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of which each item is a (character) vector with the
names of the individuals in that FS family</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parents</code></td>
<td>
<p>a (character) matrix with 2 columns and one row for each
FS family in FS, with the names of the two parents of each family</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list with 3 elements:<br>
$mrkdat: a matrix with info on the marker dosages distribution in the FS. The
first two columns are for the parents: the parent name is between (brackets)
in the column name, their mrkdid (marker dosage ID) in row 1 and their marker
dosages below that. The remaining columns are for the different mrkdids
observed in the FS: the mrkdid itself in the column name, its frequency in
row 1 and its marker dosages below that. The final column gives the frequency
of individuals with one or more missing marker dosages.<br>
$hapdat: a matrix with similar layout as mrkdat, but now with the haplotype
dosages rather than the marker dosages. Some mrkdids (columns) may not have
a haplotype dosage combination assigned (if multiple possible haplotype
combinations result in the same marker dosages)<br>
usedhap: a matrix with the dosage (0 or 1) of each marker in each of the
used haplotypes; haplotype nrs in columns, markers in rows
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(PolyHaplotyper_small)
# show the results of the first FS family in the first haploblock:
showOneFS(FSnr=1, hbresults=phresults[[1]], mrkDosage=phdos,
         FS=phFS, parents=phpar)

</code></pre>
