<h2>Defunct functions from package <span class="pkg">pedantics</span>.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The functions listed below have not been transferred from pedantics to
pedtricks with no short-term plan to implement them since they were relying
on C code that need to be heavily updated.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In addition, The questions about rates of pedigree error typically
encountered, and their effects on inference of elementary QG parameters are
basically settled (Charmantier &amp; Réale 2005, Morrissey <em>et al.</em> 2007,
Firth <em>et al.</em> 2015, Bourret &amp; Garant 2017), and outstanding questions will
not plausibly be supported by these functions or any straightforward
modifications thereof.
