<h2>Calculate Text Distance</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>When two vectors are given, this calculates the text distance between them;
text distance is calculated as the proportion of unmatched frequencies, i.e.,
the number of unmatched frequencies divided by the total frequencies among
the two vectors. However, if neither vector has any values
at all, their distance equals the number provided in the zeroes argument,
which is .5 by default. When two matrices are given, the text distance
between corresponding columns is calculated.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">textDist(x, y, zeroes = 0.5)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector or matrix</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector or matrix of the same dimension as x</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>zeroes</code></td>
<td>
<p>Text distance when both vectors are zero vectors; default is .5</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>When x and y are vectors, the text distance between them. For
example, between vectors (1,2,0) and (0,1,1), a total of 5 frequencies are 
present. However, position 1 matches nothing when it could have
matched 1 frequency, position 2 matches 1 frequency when it could have  
matched both positions, so 1 remains unmatched. Position 3 matches nothing  
when it could have matched 1. So we have 3 unmatched positions divided by 5 
frequencies, resulting in a text distance of 3/5=.6. If x and y are matrices, 
a vector with the text distance between corresponding columns is returned. So 
for two 4x2 matrices, a vector with two values is returned, one with the text 
distance between the first columns of the matrices, and the second one with 
the text distance between the second columns of the matrices. For large sets 
of data, it is recommended to use matrices as it is much more efficient than 
calculating column by column.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">#text distance between two vectors
textDist(c(1,2,0),c(0,1,1))
(M1=matrix(c(0,1,0,2,0,10,0,14),4))
(M2=matrix(c(12,0,8,0,1,3,1,2),4))
#text distance between corresponding columns of M1 and M2
textDist(M1,M2)
</code></pre>
