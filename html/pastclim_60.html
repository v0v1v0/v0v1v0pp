<h2>Documentation for <em>HYDE 3.3</em> dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This database presents an update and expansion of the History Database of
the Global Environment (HYDE, v 3.3) and replaces former HYDE 3.2
version from 2017. HYDE is and internally consistent combination of
updated historical population estimates and land use. Categories
include cropland, with a new distinction into irrigated and rain fed
crops (other than rice) and irrigated and rain fed rice. Also grazing
lands are provided, divided into more intensively used pasture,
converted rangeland and non-converted natural (less intensively used)
rangeland. Population is represented by maps of total, urban, rural
population and population density as well as built-up area.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The period covered is 10 000 BCE to 2023 CE. Spatial resolution is
5 arc minutes (approx. 85 km2 at the equator). The full <em>HYDE 3.3</em> release
contains: a Baseline estimate scenario, a Lower estimate scenario and an
Upper estimate scenario. Currently only the baseline scenario is available
in <code>pastclim</code>
</p>
<p>More details on the dataset are available on its
dedicated <a href="https://landuse.sites.uu.nl/hyde-project/">website</a>.

for the HYDE 3.2 (there is no current publication for 3.3):
