<h2>The Minimum Distance Between States in the Gleditsch-Ward System, 1886-2019</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are non-directed dyad-year data for the minimum distance between states in the Gleditsch-Ward state system from
1886 to 2018. The data are generated from the <span class="pkg">cshapes</span> package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gw_mindist
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 868813 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>gwcode1</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the Gleditsch-Ward state system code for the first state</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gwcode2</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the Gleditsch-Ward state system code for the second state</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>year</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the year</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>mindist</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the minimum distance between states on Jan. 1 of the year, in kilometers</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data are generated from the <span class="pkg">cshapes</span> package. The package authors purport that the data
are generated to be compatible with the Gleditsch-Ward system. I trust them on this; indeed, Gleditsch is one of the
authors of the <span class="pkg">cshapes</span> package.
</p>
<p>Data are automatically generated (by default) as directed dyad-years. I elect to make them non-directed for space
considerations. Making non-directed dyad-year data into directed dyad-year data isn't too difficult in R. It just
looks weird to see the code that does it.
</p>
<p>Previous versions of these data were for the minimum distance as of Dec. 31 of the referent year. These are now Jan. 1.
Most of the data I prove elsewhere in this package are  to be understood as the data as they were at the <em>start</em> of
the year. This is how I process, for example, the <code>capitals</code> data as they get merged in the <code>add_capital_distance()</code>
function. However, the script that generates these data are set at Jan. 1 of the year and not Dec. 31. Right now, the <span class="pkg">cshapes</span>
does not appear to work on my system and I do not know why. Fortunately, the package authors made these data available.
