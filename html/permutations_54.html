<h2>
The dodecahedron group
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Permutations comprising the dodecahedron group on either its faces or
its edges; also the full dodecahedron group
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package provides a number of objects for investigating dodecahedral
groups:
</p>
<p>Object <code>dodecahedron_face</code> is a cycle object with 60 elements
corresponding to the permutations of the faces of a dodecahedron,
numbered 1-12 as in the megaminx net.  Object <code>dodecahedron_edge</code>
is the corresponding object for permuting the edges of a dodecahedron.
The edges are indexed by the lower of the two adjoining facets on the
megaminx net.
</p>
<p>Objects <code>full_dodecahedron_face</code> and <code>full_dodecahedron_edge</code>
give the 120 elements of the full dodecahedron group, that is, the
dodecahedron group including reflections.  NB: these objects are
<strong>not</strong> isomorphic to S5.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>File <code>zzz_dodecahedron.R</code> is not really intended to be
human-readable.  The source file is in <code>inst/dodecahedron_group.py</code>
and <code>inst/full_dodecahedron_group.py</code> which contain documented
python source code.
